By embracing innovative technologies and adopting a comprehensive approach to carbon management, the companies are paving the way for a more sustainable future.', 'The automotive industry is in the middle of a revolution, and Korea is becoming a severe player in hydrogen engine production. Hyundai and Kia have recently showcased the first hydrogen combustion engine prototype the carmakers ambitious attempt to take on the Japanese, who have long dominated this emerging field. This article examines South Koreas key moves, H2 implications, and the global race towards clean mobility. Hyundai and Kia are leading the hydrogen technology revolution in the automotive industry Hyundai and Kia Motors Corporation of Korea are at the forefront of leading change in the hydrogen technology industry. Their hydrogen combustion engine prototype is a giant step towards green automobiles that meet critical environmental issues. The HyundaiKia Carbonless Engine Research Laboratory states that this prototype reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 99 and fine particles by 90. They also demonstrate the prospects for hydrogen engines in achieving performance characteristics while at the same time reducing the negative impact on the environment, which is necessary for the development of effective sustainable transport solutions. Furthermore, this technological development is another revolution in the automotive industry as more clean energy sources are feasible. The highpressure combustion system used in the new engine injects hydrogen at a pressure of 30 bar, a significant advance in vehicle efficiency compared to existing hydrogen systems. This innovative approach shows that hydrogen can be a longterm solution to environmentally friendly transport, so it is a severe contender in the global automotive industry. Overcoming significant infrastructure challenges in hydrogen refueling networks One of the significant challenges noted as impeding the cause of hydrogenpowered vehicles is the absence of a proper refueling network. Unlike electric cars with rapidly expanding charging infrastructure, hydrogen cars have not yet gotten off the ground. Understanding this problem, Hyundai and Kia are working on cars with a more extended range, which can minimize the urgency of establishing hydrogen refueling stations. This strategic focus makes hydrogenpowered cars cover longer distances in a single refueling than batterypowered cars, making them convenient for consumers during adoption. Also, it does not have the disadvantage of being compared to electric vehicles, which must be charged frequently. Hyundai and Kias proposed driving ranges could dramatically change longdistance mobility and reduce consumer concerns about hydrogen refueling stations. The company is also growing its hydrogen ecosystem, HTWO, to better develop and manufacture hydrogen fuel cells. This approach is necessary to drive the development of vehicles using hydrogen fuel and the necessary refueling infrastructure globally. In this respect, by attacking infrastructure issues directly, Korea is establishing itself as a pioneer in the hydrogen economy, thus increasing its rivalry with Japan even more. Koreas entry into hydrogen engine production challenges Japans longstanding dominance Since the 1990s, Japan has continued to dominate hydrogen technology, primarily through Toyotas development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles such as the Mirai. However, Koreas entry into the hydrogen engine market could be considered a strategic shift that could seriously threaten Japan. Hyundai and Kia aim at a broader range of traditional car owners by targeting fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines. Hydrogen engines, like ordinary internal combustion engines, are familiar to consumers. This could increase acceptance and adoption because drivers must not adapt to entirely different technology. In addition, Korea also has plans for automotive technology, which are not limited to hydrogen vehicles but also hydrogen generation, distribution, and storage. This wideranging plan suggests a plan of action to build a hydrogen economy, strengthening Koreas place in the global clean energy competition. The promising future of hydrogen technology for sustainable mobility solutions Hydrogen engine technology is not just a new chapter in the Korean automotive story but is revolutionizing the worldwide clean energy transport story. Hyundai and Kia are at the forefront of hydrogen engine creation the technology might transform consumer perception and offer a more sensible solution than the current EV solutions. The emissions of these engines are nil and thus correspond with the global effort at sustainability, choosing these engines a better one, especially for environmentally conscious consumers. Hyundai and Kia keep improving their cars that run on hydrogen and investing in the hydrogen infrastructure. Regarding ecofriendly cars for the average consumer, the dream seems to be getting closer. Koreas technological advancements threaten Japans dominance and open the floodgates for keen global rivalry in clean energy transport. It may very well be that hydrogen is the answer countries seek for sustainable mobility solutions. Thus, Koreas aggressive move toward the hydrogen engine represents a turning point in the automobile field. As Hyundai and Kia progress with groundbreaking innovations in prototype and infrastructure architecture, both car companies look set to revolutionize clean energy transportation. The fight for hydrogen domination is now underway, and the stakes for international automotive customers and the environment are high, marking a new milestone in efforts to create environmentally friendly transportation technologies.', 'SEMICONDUCTORS Live Events ELECTRIC VEHICLES EV BATTERIES NIPPON STEEL CHINA You can now subscribe to our You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel Donald Trump has been elected US president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House Here is what companies in Asia have invested in the United States, what Trump has said about them and what potential U.S. business policy changes would mean for Asian companies.Asian chipmakers, led by Taiwan\\'s TSMC and South Korea\\'s Samsung Electronics, have announced plans to invest at least 117 billion in the U.S. in total, encouraged by the current U.S. administration\\'s key initiative aimed at lowering its reliance on Asia for highend chips.In return, they have received or been pledged grants and financial support amounting to at least 18.85 billion, according to Reuters\\' calculation.It\\'s unclear if Trump would roll back the scheme, which he called \"bad.\" He made comments on the campaign trail that Chineseclaimed Taiwan should pay to be protected and also accused the island of stealing business from American semiconductor companies.Taiwan\\'s GlobalWafers said on Thursday it expects the subsidy programme to continue in a Trump administration.Trump has floated the idea of a 10 or more tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., a move he says would eliminate the trade deficit.He has also threatened a 200 tariff on some imported cars, and is particularly determined to keep cars from Mexico from coming into the country.

Trump has said he would block the deal, as he has sought to woo union voters. Biden has also said he is opposed to the takeover. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States said in August the deal posed a risk to national security as it threatened the steel supply chain for critical U.S. industries, prompting Nippon Steel to pledge investments worth billions in U.S. Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled. CHINA Chinese businesses are waiting to see if Trump makes good on a threat to impose tariffs of 60 or more on imports from China, which could kickstart a fresh trade war reminiscent of the one he waged during his 20172021 presidency. The trade war hit sectors across the board, from manufacturers of vacuum cleaners to machinery, with tariffs imposed on more than 200 billion of goods. The Biden administration has kept most of the tariffs in place. Several Chinese companies were also hit with export controls by the Trump administration citing national security, such as Huawei Technologies which was barred from purchasing highend chips, crippling its smartphone business. Other Chinese tech firms targeted include ByteDance and Tencent 0700.HK, whose respective TikTok and WeChat social media apps came under threat of being banned from operating in the U.S. Some Chinese exporters are making plans to accelerate relocation or open factories outside China to cope with Trumps return. But some Chinese tech executives are betting that Trumps combative approach could work in their favour, as U.S. efforts to slow Chinas technological progress might fail to gain international support. Nazak Nikakhtar, a Commerce Department official under Trump who knows his current advisers, said she expects a Trump administration to be much more aggressive about export control policies towards China.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc NYSEHSBC stands against the other best ADR stocks to invest in. An American Depositary Receipt ADR is a certificate issued by a U.S. bank, representing shares of a foreign company. ADRs enable U.S. investors to purchase shares in foreign companies as if they were U.S. stocks, simplifying the process. This makes it easier for Americans to invest internationally and helps foreign companies attract U.S. investors without the complexities of directly listing on U.S. stock exchanges. Despite the advantages, fewer than 10 of large foreign companies list in the U.S., due to high valuations of some companies which reduce the need for a U.S. listing. Additionally, many foreign firms are often familyowned and resist listing due to concerns about losing control or compromising personal financial benefits. READ ALSO 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months and Top 8 Stocks To Buy In 8 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months. Global Markets React to Trump Era The recent victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election is poised to have significant repercussions on global markets, particularly affecting stocks in Europe, the UK, China, and Canada. Analysts from Bloomberg, Yahoo, and CNBC have provided insights into how these regions might respond to Trumps policies and market dynamics. European markets are generally expected to suffer under a Trump presidency. Emmanuel Cau, head of European Equity Strategy at Barclays, suggests that Europe may be viewed as a loser in this scenario due to Trumps protectionist trade policies and potential tariffs that could disrupt existing trade relationships. Trumps historical stance on climate change and environmental regulations could also lead to increased competition for European firms, particularly in energy sectors where U.S. companies may benefit from deregulation. Goldman Sachs analysts have echoed these concerns, forecasting that Trumps administration could create an unfavorable environment for European stocks, particularly those reliant on exports to the U.S. For the UK, the implications of a Trump presidency are mixed but lean towards caution. Bloomberg reported that an aggressively competitive U.S. market risks exacerbating existing economic stagnation in Britain. The UKs reliance on trade with the U.S. makes it particularly vulnerable to shifts in U.S. policy, especially if Trump pursues aggressive tariffs or trade barriers. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations may further complicate the UKs economic landscape under a Trump administration. China is likely to face direct challenges from Trumps trade policies, which may include increased tariffs on Chinese goods. Trumps statements indicate a willingness to impose significant tariffs on imports from China as part of his broader strategy to address trade imbalances and intellectual property concerns. This approach could lead to volatility in Chinese stock markets as investors react to potential retaliatory measures from Beijing and shifts in global supply chains. The anticipated increase in tariffs could also affect sectors heavily reliant on exports to the U.S., leading to decreased profitability for many Chinese companies. In contrast to Europe and China, Canadian stocks may experience a longterm boost from Trumps victory, despite an initial negative reaction postelection. Analysts at Bay Street believe that sectors such as commodities and natural resources could benefit from Trumps proenergy policies and potential deregulation efforts despite tariffs. However, there are concerns regarding Trumps proposed tariffs on Canadian imports, which could disrupt trade relations between the two countries. As the global market continues to navigate the implications of the Trump presidency, investors are faced with both challenges and opportunities. The potential for increased tariffs, trade barriers, and deregulation efforts has created a complex landscape for foreign companies. Despite the uncertainty, there are still many foreign companies that offer attractive investment opportunities for U.S. investors. Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screener to find the 30 largest foreign companies listed in the United States.

Shell plc NYSESHEL Upside Potential 24.98 Shell plc NYSESHEL is a global energy giant based in London, UK, with operations spanning oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing, as well as renewable energy development. The companys primary revenue streams come from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products. The company is also pivoting toward sustainability, with significant investments in lowcarbon technologies, electric vehicle charging networks, and renewable energy projects to adapt to the energy transition and meet rising global energy demand sustainably. On October 31, Shell plc NYSESHEL announced results for the JulySeptember period. The company reported adjusted earnings of 6 billion, exceeding analyst projections of 5.3 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Shell plcs NYSESHEL Free cash flow FCF rose to 10.83 billion, compared to 7.5 billion in the same quarter last year. Cash capital expenditure declined to 4.95 billion from 5.65 billion in Q3 2023. Additionally, the company announced plans to repurchase 3.5 billion in shares over the next three months while maintaining its dividend at 34 cents per share. On October 23, Shell Energy North America, a subsidiary of Shell plc NYSESHEL, announced its agreement to acquire a 100 equity stake in RISEC Holdings, LLC. RISEC owns a 609megawatt MW twounit combinedcycle gas turbine power plant located in Rhode Island, USA. This acquisition strengthens the companys longterm supply and capacity offtake position in the deregulated Independent System Operator New England ISO New England power market.', 'Its a strange position for one of Americas iconic fossil fuel producing states to be in, but there it is. The Appalachian state of West Virginia, known for its deep roots in the coal industry, is hosting a long duration energy storage venture that will help squeeze fossil fuels out of the US power generation profile. The Long Duration Energy Storage Difference The venture in question is a sprawling, newly opened factory in Weirton, West Virginia that produces long duration energy storage systems under the umbrella of the Massachusetts startup Form Energy. Long duration storage systems are not the same as the familiar lithiumion battery arrays. The most common long duration system today is pumped hydropower, but that is limited by specific site requirements and it is not reproducible in factories. In contrast, Form designed its long duration system to be factorybuilt and shipped out all over the country see more Form Energy background here. The long duration angle is a crucial one. Todays generation of lithiumion battery arrays can typically store electricity from wind and solar farms for 46 hours. Thats enough to handle daily grid balancing tasks under current conditions. However, to shepherd an increasing amount of renewable energy into the grid, the US Department of Energy anticipates that storage systems with a duration of at least 10 hours will be needed. Preferably, the storage systems of the future will last for days, weeks, or even months. In addition to accelerating the energy transition, new long duration systems that dont rely on lithium will help diversify the energy storage supply chain, potentially freeing up more lithium for use in EV batteries and other crucial areas. As a ripple effect, nonlithium energy storage systems could enable the US to avoid an excessive buildout of new lithium mines, and avoid the consequent environmental and sociocultural impacts. The IronAir Difference Form Energy fits the long duration energy storage bill and the supply chain diversity, too. The companys 100hour technology leverages the rusting process that occurs during the interaction of iron, air, and water. The basic principle of operation is reversible rusting, Form explains. While discharging, the battery breathes in oxygen from the air and converts iron metal to rust. While charging, the application of an electrical current converts the rust back to iron and the battery breathes out oxygen. The massproducible batteries consist of cells about one meter tall, each with its own iron and air electrodes. The electrolyte is a nonflammable, water based solution that Form describes as similar to the formula used in AA batteries. About 50 cells are packed into an enclosure about the size of a washerdryer. Scaling up to the megawatt level requires assembling hundreds of these enclosures into a group that Form calls a power block. The result is a gridconnected energy storage system that can be configured from doubledigit power blocks up triple digits. CoalKilling Energy Storage Factory To Be Expanded, Already Form selected Weirton for its the new battery factory out of a pool of 500 potential sites. Among the deciding factors was handy access to key transportation routes including the Ohio river along with rail and highway networks, indicating the companys intention to export its technology from West Virginia to points elsewhere around the country. Work on the project began in May of 2023 and was completed last spring. In its current iteration, Form Factory 1 is a 550,000squarefoot facility with 300 employees. Thats just for starters. Earlier this month, Form described plans for expanding the facility to approximately double its current size. By 2028, Form Factory 1 is projected to have more than 1 million squarefeet of manufacturing space, employ at least 750 people, and have an annual manufacturing capacity of 500 megawatts, at minimum, explained Form CEO and Cofounder Mateo Jaramillo in a press statement. Whos Gonna Pay For All This? If all goes according to plan, Forms long duration energy storage system will help accelerate the energy transition in states all across the US regardless of partisan politics, and the taxpaying public of West Virginia can give themselves a group hug for supporting it. To motivate the company to set up shop in Weirton, state office holders provided Form with an incentive package worth 290 million, including use of the former Weirton Steel complex. As part of the deal, the state will retain ownership of the land and buildings as collateral to guarantee the states investment, while Form Energy leases it back as it meets certain project requirements, the West Virginia Senate reported in February of 2023. In September, the US Department of Energy also chipped in for the expansion plan, providing a tobenegotiated 150 million award through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Further enabling the factory rampup is a 405 million Series F financing round led by T. Rowe Price, announced by Form on October 9. The round attracted new investor GE Vernova, which cemented its investment by nailing down a strategic relationship with Form. The series F round also attracted existing Form investors including TPG Rise Climate, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Capricorns Technology Impact Funds, Coatue, Energy Impact Partners, MITs The Engine Ventures, NGP, Temasek, GIC, Prelude Ventures, Claure Group, Gigascale Capital, Blindspot Ventures, and VamosVentures. Long Duration Energy Storage Trumps The AntiESG Canard Deploying both public and private funds to remake a former centerpiece of the domestic coal industry into the long duration energy storage capital of the US is rich in irony. Its also a poke in they eye of certain state officials who have been taking steps to obstruct renewable energy investing. Exhibit A is State Treasurer Riley Moore, who is currently running to represent US Congressional District 2 in West Virginia. Moore has been front and center in a multistate campaign to protect fossil energy stakeholders, under the guise of protecting public pension funds from ESG environment, social, governance investing principles. As Treasurer he proposed establishing a Restricted Financial Institution List in West Virginia, prohibiting state agencies from doing business with firms that boycott fossil energy. The state legislature took up Moores proposal and passed it into law in 2022. He promptly tapped BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo for inclusion on the list that same year. Last April he added Citigroup, TD Bank, The Northern Trust Company, and HSBC Holdings. All institutions on the list will now be ineligible to provide banking services to the State, noted the West Virginia Press Association reported on April 9. The WVPA also cited Moores official statement on the matter. My action today represents our continued commitment to protect state funds from furthering these politically motivated, subjective ESG policies that attempt to cut off financing for our coal, oil and natural gas industries and harm our state, Moore said. We cannot allow institutions that seek to destroy our states critical energy industries and the economic activity they generate to also profit from handling the very taxpayer dollars they seek to diminish, he added for good measure. Apparently the state officials who supported taxpayer financial aid for the Form venture did not get the memo. Follow me via LinkTree, or tinamcasey on Threads, LinkedIn, and Bluesky.

The Board was unanimous in Dan\\'s appointment and he has long been identified as the successor to CEO following his work for the Group as CEO of Debenhams. 2. Frasers appears intent on disrupting boohoo\\'s Business Review and acting only in its own commercial selfinterest. Frasers has prior history of this sort of corporate behaviour The Board is concerned that Frasers is using its significant shareholdings in UK retailers, including boohoo, to further its own selfinterest at the expense of other shareholders. Shareholders should ask themselves what Frasers\\' true intentions are, and why is it apparently seeking to disrupt the Business Review. Is it purely to maximise value, or is there an ulterior motive to acquire boohoo\\'s assets for below market value? This is not the first time Frasers has acted in this way without having set out details of an alternative credible plan. Frasers did similar in relation to Studio Retail Group where it used its shareholding of just under 30 per cent. to exert significant pressure on the existing management team. This included attempts by Mike Ashley to be appointed as Chairman of the board and a separate shareholder requisition with the objective of installing Benjamin Gardener to the board. The business was then put into administration. Frasers ultimately succeeded in acquiring the business out of administration for 1 and settled the businesses\\' remaining secured liabilities for approximately 50 per cent. of their face value. Studio Retail\\'s other shareholders are likely to lose the entire value of their investments.. 3. Shareholders are being offered no protections in relation to the obvious risks presented by Frasers\\' Demands The Board believes it is fundamental to the successful outcome of the Business Review, as well as the operation of the Group as a whole, that it maintains high standards of corporate governance throughout the business. The Board has stated as a matter of public record that it is open to Frasers\\' having board representation in the form of a single nonexecutive director appointment and has repeatedly requested that Frasers provide appropriate safeguards to manage the obvious conflicts of interest that exist and will arise. They have ignored the Group\\'s repeated requests on this matter. Mahmud Kamani is willing to give the same commitments requested by the Board of Frasers, demonstrating his alignment with the interests of Shareholders and maximising value for all Shareholders. 4. Mike Ashley is conflicted and not a suitable appointment to the Board Mike Ashley is the controller of Frasers, with a 73 shareholding, and is listed by Frasers as having a significant influence over its daytoday decision making. The Board considers Frasers to be a competitor of all of boohoo\\'s core brands across its own brands and investments. Frasers and Mike Ashley have history of exerting pressure on competitors and Shareholders should be concerned about the possibility of Mike Ashley joining our board. 5. Mike Lennon is a practicing insolvency expert with a history of working closely with Frasers Shareholders should ask themselves why Frasers would want him in situ at boohoo Mike Lennon is a restructuring and insolvency practitioner who lists due diligence, transaction negotiation and posttransaction stabilisation amongst his professional skills. Mike Lennon has acted on several administration processes for Frasers, including recent acquisitions from JD Sports that Frasers has put into administration such as Prevu, Kids Cavern, Base Childrenswear and Field Trek. The Board therefore considers it to be fairly obvious why Frasers, a serial purchaser of retail businesses, would like to appoint Mike Lennon. It is equally obvious to the Board why Mike Lennon is not therefore a suitable candidate for appointment as a director of boohoo as Frasers has demanded. 6. The Board is not deliberately seeking confrontation with Frasers, but will at all times act in the best interests of the Company and all Shareholders The Board has not \"stonewalled\" Frasers, despite their accusations to the contrary. Our Board has instead maintained that it needs to act in the interests of all Shareholders, not merely Frasers. By rejecting Frasers\\' Demands, Shareholders will give the Board a mandate to insist on the commitments the Company requires from Frasers. The proposals are not in the best interest of all Shareholders the Board recommends VOTING AGAINST ALL Resolutions at the General Meeting Dan Finley, Chief Executive Officer of boohoo Group plc, said \"I reiterate the commitment I made on my appointment to working to unlock significant value for all shareholders. We are taking decisive steps to deliver on this promise and will continue to do so during the coming months as I begin replicating the success I achieved at Debenhams. We have outlined in the circular posted today why the proposals from Frasers are not in the best interests of all shareholders, and we look forward to receiving shareholder support and maximising value for all shareholders as we move forward.\" A copy of the Circular is published on the Company\\'s website at This summary should be read in conjunction with the full text of the Circular.

         "['According to a new report from SP Global, the companys electricity consumption currently accounts for eight percent of Taiwans overall usage, a figure which could rise to almost 24 percent by 2030 as TSMC continues to manufacture increasingly advanced semiconductors. TSMCs growing energy requirements could place significant pressure on both the company and Taiwan during the latter part of the decade. Data also shows that between 2016 when TSMC started producing 10nm chips and 2023, when mass production of its 3nm chips began, the companys electricity consumption more than doubled from 110GW to around 250GW. Other sustainability reports from SP place TSMCs electricity consumption at more than twice that of Intels 90GW and greater than SK Hynixs 125GW. Working on the assumption that wafer shipments will grow by 90 percent compared to 2023 levels, modeling from SP shows that TSMCs electricity would reach 794GW, with a 50 percent growth prediction still having consumption totaling 418GW by 2030. Furthermore, this power crunch will only be exacerbated as the company adopts the energyintensive extreme ultraviolet lithography processes. The report also shows that in 2022, TSMCs power consumption per 12inch wafer mask layer was 27.7kW, this figure has jumped to 40.5kW as 3nm production scaled up in 2023. Although TSMC has a net zero by 2050 policy in place and has taken steps to try and reduce its emissions and move to 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, the companys electricity consumption is by far its biggest greenhouse gas emitter. For context, while the company is consuming around eight percent of Taiwans overall usage, the percentage of electricity currently being generated by renewable energy across Taiwan currently sits at around six percent.', 'SK hynix, MediaTek to present at SEMI Midwest Breakfast Forum degree program industry leaders to gather in Washington, D.C.

It is what President Yoon Sukyeol calls among the most noteworthy outcomes under an AseanSouth Korea comprehensive strategic partnership CSP that will be established at the Asean meetings in Vientiane, Laos, later this week. In an exclusive interview with The Straits Times, he said With Asean being one of the fastestgrowing digital markets in the world, mutually beneficial cooperation in the digital sector will create a synergy that brings tangible benefits to our peoples. South Korea, home to global leading tech companies such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and LG Electronics, is known for its innovative technology in advanced semiconductors, AI and quantum computing. Yoon said the country can help Asean by building highperformance computing infrastructure and data ecosystems, and training skilled workers in digital technology and AI. In addition, South Korea aims to support the Asean member states in their efforts to build capacity against the everincreasing threat of cyber attacks by helping promote education in cyber security, and train experts in this field, he said in written replies to questions from ST. Through these efforts, Korea will become a key partner of Aseans digital transformation. Yoon is on a sixday trip to SouthEast Asia from Oct 6 to 11, visiting Manila, Singapore and Laos. He arrived in Singapore from Manila on Oct 7 and will depart for Vientiane on Oct 9 for the annual Asean meetings. The CSP, to be established on the 35th anniversary of dialogue relations, elevates the AseanSouth Korea relationship to the same level as that of the blocs with the other Asean Plus Three dialogue partners. Asean and China established a CSP in 2021, while ties with Japan were upgraded to the same level in 2023. At a time of rising geopolitical tensions in the region, one of the key outcomes being called for by the South Korean leader under the CSP is strategic coordination with Asean in politics and security. South Korea will actively participate in joint military exercises with Asean the bloc held its first exercise in September 2023 focusing on humanitarian relief step up defence industry cooperation, and work with Asean to jointly address emerging threats such as cyber and transnational crime, Yoon said. He added that South Korea highly appreciates how Asean has spoken in one voice to urge North Korea to halt its nuclear and missile development, which violates United Nations Security Council resolutions. Another challenge facing Asean is the economic and social impacts of climate change, said the South Korean leader. South Korea aims to share technology for clean energy with Asean and broaden its investments beyond traditional sectors like textiles and chemicals to focus on electric vehicles, batteries and biotechnology, said Yoon. With the Partnership for AseanSouth Korea Methane Action launched in 2023, Yoon said South Korea is striving to share its clean energy technologies with Asean while helping to redouble the efforts to reduce methane emissions, one of the main causes of global warming. Moreover, South Korea will help Asean achieve carbon neutrality and green transition through a variety of projects aimed at alleviating air pollution and reducing carbon emissions through forestation. Other key areas of cooperation under the CSP will be to enhance the AseanROK Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement FTA as well as peopletopeople exchanges and cultural cooperation. Asean is South Koreas secondlargest trading partner after China, with bilateral trade having more than tripled since the AseanSouth Korea FTA took effect in 2007. About 6,000 South Korean businesses have a presence in Asean, representing nearly half of all South Korean enterprises in overseas markets. Asean is the countrys secondlargest investment destination after the US. South Koreas cumulative investment in Asean stands at approximately US150 billion S195 billion, and is projected to surpass US200 billion within the next five years. With challenges such as digital transformation, supply chain security and climate change, Mr Yoon told ST he believes that the South Korean and Asean partnership needs to evolve beyond trade to include economic security. I believe the AseanROK FTA can serve as a pivotal platform in this effort, he said. In Singapore, he and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will witness the signing of an extradition treaty and the exchange of several memorandums of understanding to enhance cooperation in areas including trade, startups, energy, food safety and technology. In the written interview, Yoon said he looks forward to the two countries closely collaborating, including in intelligence sharing to combat the proliferation of illegal digital content and drug use. South Korea has been rocked by a series of deepfake porn crimes, with most of the perpetrators being teenage boys. According to data from its education ministry, 799 students from elementary to high school fell victim to deepfake videos in 2024, along with 31 teachers. South Koreas National Assembly passed a Bill on Sept 25, seeking a jail sentence of up to three years or a fine of up to 30 million won S29,000 for people found knowingly possessing or viewing deepfake porn. In Singapore, PM Wong announced on Oct 1 that a government agency will be set up by 2025 to help victims of such crimes, and a new law will improve protection for victims. Yoon said Both countries are facing serious social problems caused by the proliferation of illegal digital content and drug use. As advocates of the rule of law, South Korea and Singapore will work together to enable close collaboration including intelligence sharing between law enforcement authorities, along with the strict enforcement of the law. Yoon, who had discussions with PM Wong at the virtual AI Seoul Summit in May, said the two countries are optimal partners in efforts to establish global norms on AI. Establishing a green economy is key to sustainable development, as is addressing low birth rates, which Yoon said are common goals shared by South Korea and Singapore. Both countries concluded a memorandum of understanding on green economy cooperation in 2023 and are among the countries that signed the IndoPacific Economic Framework Clean Economy Agreement in June 2024. Yoon said he looked forward to expanding cooperation with Singapore in these areas, including exchanging policy insights on issues such as childcare leave and a more open stance on immigration to mitigate demographic issues. He is accompanied on his visit to Singapore by First Lady Kim Keon Hee, senior government officials and business leaders, including Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Jaeyong and Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Euisun. Yoon, a wellknown foodie, said he hopes to tuck into Hainanese chicken rice and satay. He recalled visiting Singapore in 2003 during a stopover at Changi Airport and being deeply impressed by Singapores cultural diversity and dynamism during his walk downtown, where he came across many different places of worship all together in one area. He said I have studied various Singaporean models of government reforms, educational innovations and urban development. I believe that mutual interest and understanding between South Korea and Singapore will significantly help strengthen cooperation in various fields going forward.

According to data from its education ministry, 799 students from elementary to high school fell victim to deepfake videos in 2024, along with 31 teachers. South Koreas National Assembly passed a Bill on Sept 25, seeking a jail sentence of up to three years or a fine of up to 30 million won S29,000 for people found knowingly possessing or viewing deepfake porn. In Singapore, PM Wong announced on Oct 1 that a government agency will be set up by 2025 to help victims of such crimes, and a new law will improve protection for victims. Mr Yoon said Both countries are facing serious social problems caused by the proliferation of illegal digital content and drug use. As advocates of the rule of law, South Korea and Singapore will work together to enable close collaboration including intelligence sharing between law enforcement authorities, along with the strict enforcement of the law. Mr Yoon, who had discussions with PM Wong at the virtual AI Seoul Summit in May, said the two countries are optimal partners in efforts to establish global norms on AI. Establishing a green economy is key to sustainable development, as is addressing low birth rates, which Mr Yoon said are common goals shared by South Korea and Singapore. Both countries concluded a memorandum of understanding on green economy cooperation in 2023 and are among the countries that signed the IndoPacific Economic Framework Clean Economy Agreement in June 2024. Mr Yoon said he looked forward to expanding cooperation with Singapore in these areas, including exchanging policy insights on issues such as childcare leave and a more open stance on immigration to mitigate demographic issues. He is accompanied on his visit to Singapore by First Lady Kim Keon Hee, senior government officials and business leaders, including Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Jaeyong and Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Euisun. Mr Yoon, a wellknown foodie, said he hopes to tuck into Hainanese chicken rice and satay. He recalled visiting Singapore in 2003 during a stopover at Changi Airport and being deeply impressed by Singapores cultural diversity and dynamism during his walk downtown, where he came across many different places of worship all together in one area. He said I have studied various Singaporean models of government reforms, educational innovations and urban development. I believe that mutual interest and understanding between South Korea and Singapore will significantly help strengthen cooperation in various fields going forward.

It is what President Yoon Suk Yeol calls among the most noteworthy outcomes under an ASEANSouth Korea comprehensive strategic partnership CSP that will be established at the ASEAN meetings in Vientiane, Laos, later this week. In an exclusive interview with The Straits Times, he said With ASEAN being one of the fastestgrowing digital markets in the world, mutually beneficial cooperation in the digital sector will create a synergy that brings tangible benefits to our peoples. South Korea, home to global leading tech companies such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and LG Electronics, is known for its innovative technology in advanced semiconductors, AI and quantum computing. Yoon said the country can help ASEAN by building highperformance computing infrastructure and data ecosystems, and training skilled workers in digital technology and AI. In addition, South Korea aims to support the ASEAN member states in their efforts to build capacity against the everincreasing threat of cyber attacks by helping promote education in cyber security, and train experts in this field, he said in written replies to questions from ST. Through these efforts, Korea will become a key partner of Aseans digital transformation. Yoon is on a sixday trip to Southeast Asia from October 6 to 11, visiting Manila, Singapore and Laos. He arrived in Singapore from Manila on October 7 and will depart for Vientiane on October 9 for the annual ASEAN meetings. The CSP, to be established on the 35th anniversary of dialogue relations, elevates the AseanSouth Korea relationship to the same level as that of the blocs with the other ASEAN Plus Three dialogue partners. ASEANand China established a CSP in 2021, while ties with Japan were upgraded to the same level in 2023. At a time of rising geopolitical tensions in the region, one of the key outcomes being called for by the South Korean leader under the CSP is strategic coordination with ASEAN in politics and security. South Korea will actively participate in joint military exercises with ASEAN the bloc held its first exercise in September 2023 focusing on humanitarian relief step up defence industry cooperation, and work with ASEAN to jointly address emerging threats such as cyber and transnational crime, Yoon said. He added that South Korea highly appreciates how ASEAN has spoken in one voice to urge North Korea to halt its nuclear and missile development, which violates United Nations Security Council resolutions. Another challenge facing ASEAN is the economic and social impacts of climate change, said the South Korean leader. South Korea aims to share technology for clean energy with ASEAN and broaden its investments beyond traditional sectors like textiles and chemicals to focus on electric vehicles, batteries and biotechnology, said Yoon. With the Partnership for ASEANSouth Korea Methane Action launched in 2023, Yoon said South Korea is striving to share its clean energy technologies with ASEAN while helping to redouble the efforts to reduce methane emissions, one of the main causes of global warming. Moreover, South Korea will help ASEAN achieve carbon neutrality and green transition through a variety of projects aimed at alleviating air pollution and reducing carbon emissions through forestation. Other key areas of cooperation under the CSP will be to enhance the ASEANROK Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement FTA as well as peopletopeople exchanges and cultural cooperation. Asean is South Koreas secondlargest trading partner after China, with bilateral trade having more than tripled since the ASEANSouth Korea FTA took effect in 2007. About 6,000 South Korean businesses have a presence in ASEAN, representing nearly half of all South Korean enterprises in overseas markets. ASEAN is the countrys secondlargest investment destination after the US. South Koreas cumulative investment in ASEAN stands at approximately US150 billion, and is projected to surpass US200 billion within the next five years. With challenges such as digital transformation, supply chain security and climate change, Yoon told ST he believes that the South Korean and ASEAN partnership needs to evolve beyond trade to include economic security. I believe the ASEANROK FTA can serve as a pivotal platform in this effort, he said. Shared challenges Deepfakes, shrinking populations In Singapore, he and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will witness the signing of an extradition treaty and the exchange of several memorandums of understanding to enhance cooperation in areas including trade, startups, energy, food safety and technology.

Strategic Report Chairman\\'s Statement Future of the Company In May of this year, your Board announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of the future of the Company, including its ongoing investment management arrangements. The Board of the Company announced on 28 October 2024 that it had concluded such review. The outcome of the review was a proposal by the Board the \"Proposal\" that the Company should combine with Invesco Asia Trust plc \"Invesco Asia\", an investment trust managed by Invesco Fund Managers Limited \"IFML\". The enlarged Invesco Asia would continue to be managed by IFML under Invesco Asia\\'s existing investment objective and investment policy. Under the strategic review the Board undertook a full and robust review process and considered a wide range of options for the Company. The proposal to combine the Company with Invesco Asia was considered the most attractive outcome for shareholders, providing a partial capital return alongside the continuation of shareholders\\' investment in an investment trust that has delivered strong longterm performance managed by a highly regarded team at IFML. The combination, if approved, will create a vehicle of scale with a diversified shareholder base, a significant increase in dividend for Asia Dragon shareholders who roll over into Invesco Asia and a more competitive management fee. Furthermore, the introduction of a triennial unconditional 100 per cent. tender offer alongside ongoing buyback activity by the enlarged Invesco Asia provides a compelling approach to discount management that we expect to serve its shareholders well over time. I set out below under \\'Result of the Review\\' more background on the Proposal and its rationale and benefits to the Company\\'s shareholders. The Proposal is subject to shareholder approval at general meetings to be held in early 2025. Results In the 12 months to 31 August 2024, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index rose 12.0 in sterling total return terms. The Company\\'s net asset value \"NAV\" increased 9.3 on the same total return basis after accounting for dividends. The share price rose from 353p to 404p over the year, which, with dividends added back, yielded a total return of 16.7. This reflected a narrowing of the discount to NAV to 10.8 as at the year end, from 16.2 as at the previous financial year end. Performance Your Company posted mixed returns over the reporting year, with initial weakness in late 2023 but with performance stabilising by August 2024. The stabilisation followed a portfolio \"reset\" after the Company\\'s combination with abrdn New Dawn Investment Trust plc in November 2023, allowing the larger portfolio to invest in Australasia and up to 30 in nonbenchmark holdings. This broadened investment universe flexibility enabled the Manager to invest in quality stocks that had previously been inaccessible, positively impacting performance. Key contributors over the year included nonbenchmark stocks like ASML and ASM International in the semiconductor and technology hardware segments. As AIrelated apps and chips start to proliferate, rising demand in terms of usage and complexity is boosting the semiconductor and consumer electronics segments. Other key contributors included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, power testing services provider Chroma ATE and passive component supplier Yageo in Taiwan, as well as Indian real estate group Godrej Properties. I would also highlight that China, which was the biggest detractor from performance over the interim period, remained a key detractor for the full financial year. As I mentioned in my interim statement, the Manager has undertaken a thorough review of the Company\\'s Chinese holdings, and resized exposures where appropriate. This was implemented in view of the nearterm headwinds in China, namely, a slower than expected consumer recovery and a stillweak property sector, amid a broader soft macro backdrop. As a result, the Manager significantly reduced overall Chinese exposure. With a focus on good earnings visibility and steady cash flow generation, the Manager has added or increased exposure to Chinese holdings that show such attributes but exited positions where the outlook is more uncertain. The Manager retains high conviction in the Chinese holdings that remain in the portfolio, and continues to see significant value opportunities in this market. However, the Manager remains watchful of structural challenges in the country as well as more details on the recent stimulus measures and execution and implementation of policies. Encouragingly, in the latter part of the financial year from 1 January 2024 to 31 August 2024, the Chinese exposure has turned around to become a marginal contributor to the Company\\'s relative performance. The Manager\\'s Report covers the Company\\'s performance in greater detail. Result of the Review In May this year, your Board announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of the future of the Company, including its ongoing investment management arrangements. Under the review, the Board gave consideration to retaining the existing manager, appointing a new external thirdparty manager and entering into a combination with another investment trust. The Board was pleased by the interest it received from a large number of highquality management groups, which were evaluated by the Board with the assistance of Stanhope Consulting. The Board announced on 28 October 2024 that it had agreed heads of terms with Invesco Asia and IFML for a combination of the assets of the Company with Invesco Asia by means of a section 110 scheme of reconstruction and voluntary winding up of the Company. In reaching this decision, the Board noted a number of attractions to a combination with Invesco Asia Strong LongTerm Investment Performance Invesco Asia has delivered a total return of 49.4 per cent. over the five years to 30 September 2024, representing outperformance of 23.2 per cent. against the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index which has delivered a fiveyear total return of 26.2 per cent. over the same period. Unconstrained Investment Approach Invesco Asia has a highly rated and experienced investment team with an unconstrained investment approach and a focus on valuation whereby the managers seek to identify stocks that have become dislocated from fair value with a potential catalyst for change. The Board of the Company was impressed by the distinctive and disciplined valueoriented investment approach employed by IFML which has delivered attractive returns for Invesco Asia shareholders over the long term. Aligned Investment Exposure The Proposal will allow shareholders to continue their investment in a core Asia exJapan equity strategy. Increased Dividend The Company\\'s shareholders will benefit from a significant increase in dividend as a result of Invesco Asia\\'s policy of paying a distribution of 4 per cent. of NAV per annum which will move from semiannual to four quarterly payments each equal to 1 per cent. of NAV. Depth of Resource Invesco Ltd, a global asset manager with 1.8 trillion of AUM, including 15.9 billion in Asia and EM Equities as at 30 September 2024, will remain as the investment manager of the combined entity. Invesco Asia will continue to benefit from the expertise of its portfolio managers, Fiona Yang and Ian Hargreaves, and from the depth of resource and experience offered by the wider Asian Emerging Markets Equities Team. Partial Cash Exit The Proposal will provide the Company\\'s shareholders with the opportunity to elect to exit part or all of their holding in the Company for cash, subject to an overall limit of 25 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company excluding shares held in treasury the \"Cash Exit\". Continued Scale The combination with Invesco Asia will allow the Company\\'s shareholders to continue to participate in a vehicle of scale, with the enlarged Invesco Asia expected to be a constituent of the FTSE 250, notwithstanding the potential substantial return of capital by the Company pursuant to the Cash Exit. Periodic Exit Opportunity Following completion of the Proposal, Invesco Asia will introduce a triennial unconditional tender offer of up to 100 per cent. of the issued share capital of Invesco Asia, with the first tender offer expected to take place in 2028. Discount Management Policy Invesco Asia will maintain its stated average discount target of less than 10 per cent. of NAV calculated on a cumincome basis over the financial year. Competitive Management Fee IFML has agreed that, with effect from the admission to listing and trading of the new Invesco Asia shares issued in connection with the Proposal, the management fee payable by Invesco Asia to IFML will be reduced to 0.75 per cent. on the initial 125m of net assets 0.6 per cent. of net assets between 125m and 450m and 0.5 per cent. on net assets in excess of 450m. The new Invesco Asia fee structure will result in a lower blended management fee than is currently payable by the Company. Shareholder Register The Proposal will allow a number of shareholders to consolidate their holdings across the two companies while also creating a more diversified shareholder base through a combination of the balance of the two share registers. The Proposal will be subject to approval by the shareholders of both the Company and Invesco Asia in addition to regulatory and tax approvals. The Company and Invesco Asia have each received an irrevocable undertaking from City of London Investment Management Limited representing 30 per cent. of the Company\\'s issued share capital and 21 per cent. of Invesco Asia\\'s issued share capital in each case excluding treasury shares and letters of intent or indications of support from shareholders representing a further 25 per cent. of the Company\\'s issued share capital and 17 per cent. of Invesco Asia\\'s issued share capital in each case excluding treasury shares, to support the Proposal. A circular providing further details of the Proposal and convening general meetings to approve the Proposal, and a prospectus in respect of the issue of new Invesco Asia shares in connection with the Proposal, are expected to be posted to the Company\\'s shareholders in due course. The Proposal is anticipated to become effective in early 2025. In the event of the Proposal becoming effective, a number of the Company\\'s Directors will join the four existing directors of Invesco Asia on the board of the enlarged company. Gearing The Board continues to believe that the sensible use of modest financial gearing should enhance returns to shareholders over the longer term, being one of the advantages of the closed end structure. Cognisant of the ongoing strategic review, the Company extended the maturity of its unsecured 50 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the \"RCF\" with The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited, London Branch the \"Lender\" which was due to expire on 29 July 2024, out to 29 March 2025. At the same time the principal amount available under the RCF was increased to 75 million. The 25 million increase was used to repay the Company\\'s 25 million Fixed Rate Loan with the Lender which also matured on 29 July 2024. As a consequence, the Company now has a single unsecured 75m RCF with the Lender, under which the Company retains flexibility to repay and cancel the facility at any time during its remaining life, subject to five business days\\' notice. Under the new facility, the Company has made short term revolving drawings of GBP 25 million at a current allin rate of 6.15 and HKD 480 million at a current allin rate of 5.28. The Company\\'s total borrowings remained broadly unchanged at 71.8 million in Sterling terms at year end, giving a net gearing figure of 6.2. The amounts drawn down were unchanged at the time of writing and remain comfortably within the covenant limits. Discounts and Share Buybacks The discount level of the Company\\'s shares is closely monitored by the Board and share buybacks are undertaken when appropriate. During the year ended 31 August 2024, 9.5 million shares were bought back into treasury at a cost of 34.2 million 2023 5.9 million shares were bought back into treasury at a cost of 23.7 million. Since 31 August 2024, a further 891,234 shares have been bought back into treasury at a cost of 3.7 million. The discount at the financial year end was 10.8 2023 16.2. As at 21 November 2024 the discount was 10.6. Annual General Meeting and Dividend In the light of the outcome of the strategic review, the Board intends to convene the AGM in respect of the financial year ended 31 August 2024 to align with the dates for the general meetings of the Company required to implement the combination with Invesco Asia. Accordingly, the Notice of AGM, which will include an explanation of the proposed AGM business, will be sent to shareholders as a separate standalone document at the same time as the shareholder circular relating to the combination with Invesco Asia. The Company\\'s revenue return per share was 6.7p for the year to 31 August 2024 2023 7.1p. As the posting date for the circular and Notice of AGM will be after the publication of the Annual Report, the Board has declared an interim dividend for the year ended 31 August 2024 of 6.6p per Ordinary share 2023 6.6p, in lieu of a final dividend, to allow for a similar dividend payment date as in recent years. The interim dividend will be paid on 31 December 2024 to shareholders on the register on 6 December 2024. Following implementation of the Proposal it is expected that the enlarged Invesco Asia will maintain its current policy of paying an annual dividend equal to 4 per cent. of its Net Asset Value but it will increase the frequency of its dividend payments from the current halfyearly basis 2 per cent. in each of November and April to a quarterly basis four dividends of 1 per cent. every three months. The first dividend payable by the enlarged Invesco Asia to which the Company\\'s shareholders will be entitled is expected to be the quarterly dividend payable in late Aprilearly May 2025. Composition of the Board As outlined in last year\\'s Annual Report, as part of the combination with abrdn New Dawn, Donald Workman, Stephen Souchon and Nicole Yuen joined the Board as nonexecutive Directors of the Company on 9 November 2023 and were subsequently elected by shareholders at the AGM in December 2023. Following completion of a six month transition period, on 9 May 2024, Donald Workman, Charlie Ricketts and Gaynor Coley retired from the Board. On behalf of the Board I would like to reiterate our thanks to Charlie, Gaynor and Donald for their dedication, service and contributions to the Company. Outlook The US monetary policy easing cycle has begun, boosting companies and economies across Asia. Lower interest rates improve borrowing conditions, encouraging spending and investment. However, central banks must balance this with inflation and currency stability concerns. The election of Trump and Republican dominance of Capitol Hill clearly present challenges to Asia. The most obvious issue is the increased threat of tariffs, and this time not just on Chinese exports. The impact may be in part offset by the clearly stimulatory nature of the Trump package, although this may have implications for monetary conditions given the influence of US monetary conditions across the region.However, as our investment managers point out, Asia is a diverse region, and does not suffer from many of the macroeconomic imbalances seen elsewhere given generally strong fiscal positions, high domestic savings, scope to stimulate domestic growth and robust external positions. There should be plenty of opportunities for active stock pickers. Consequently, the Board remains positive about the outlook for Asian equities. The corporate outlook is strong due to broadbased growth and strong fundamentals among leading companies. More broadly, Asia is evolving, with more growth opportunities beyond China. India is fast growing as an economic power in its own right, while Southeast Asia is benefiting from supply chain diversification amid geopolitical uncertainty. The AI boom in Asia\\'s semiconductor industry highlights the region\\'s role in global innovation, presenting investment opportunities in Korea and Taiwan. Other growth themes include the green transition, with Asia leading in electric vehicles, smart grids, and renewable energy. Rising affluence spurs growth in financial services, while urbanisation and the infrastructure boom benefit property developers and mortgage providers. James Will Chairman 22 November 2024 Investment Manager\\'s Review Performance As the Chairman notes in his statement, we continued to see macro factors play an outsized role in influencing investor sentiment and equity markets across Asia and globally over the review period. These included a slowing China amid a slower than expected consumer recovery postCovid and property downturn, US monetary policy trajectory and geopolitical uncertainty. At the same time, we saw optimism over potential US rate cuts, signs of resilience in corporate earnings and strength in the technology sector. Over the 12 months to 31 August 2024, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan benchmark index rose 12.0 in sterling total return terms, while the Company\\'s net asset value \"NAV\" increased 9.3 on the same total return basis after accounting for dividends. Over the financial year, we witnessed mixed market fortunes across the Asia Pacific ex Japan region see chart 1 below. Within the China market, we saw a meaningful style rotation out of quality into value, and a chase for thematic names with AI and stateowned enterprise SOE reform in vogue. The Hong Kong market bore the brunt of the spillover impact, which was also exacerbated by heavy foreign capital outflows. In contrast, Taiwan and India were the best performing markets. Taiwan benefitted from a big uplift in optimism around a semiconductor sector turnaround and positive demand trends in AI applications. India\\'s strength was supported by a resilient macro backdrop, including a property boom, strong urban consumer sentiment, and robust infrastructure capex. Against this backdrop, the portfolio posted mixed returns with a weak start but stabilising performance towards the end of the financial year. We highlight three key areas of performance drivers China and Hong Kong, technology and finally India. 1. China and Hong Kong Together, China and Hong Kong were the biggest detractors, where our still significant exposure to the Chinese consumer weighed on performance see Chart 2 below. We do like many of the domestic consumptionoriented companies in China. They have been largely insulated from the geopolitical headwinds buffeting the country for years now. They have also been broadly aligned with domestic policy and the multiyear effort to shift China\\'s economic growth model away from a reliance on exports and investment to one that is domestic consumptiondriven. Most importantly, many of these companies are evidently highquality stocks with great brands, superior margins and return metrics, healthy cash flow and balance sheets. They still offer huge longterm growth potential tied to the rise of the Chinese middle class. However, over the past 18 months, this has not been a rewarding part of the market to be invested in. The Chinese consumer emerged from the pandemic with massive pentup savings, but this did not convert into spending as China failed to follow the reopening playbook seen in most other countries around the world. Instead, the gloom around the allimportant property sector, in which so much of China\\'s household wealth is tied up, weighed heavily on consumer sentiment. This was compounded by slowing economic growth and rising job insecurity. Policymakers attempted to stimulate consumption and support the property sector, but these moves proved insufficient and consumer stocks and their proxies continued to get punished despite sometimes resilient underlying fundamentals. For example, our holding in Hong Konglisted life insurer AIA Group was amongst the largest performance detractors despite the fact that it delivered solid earnings growth. Baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai was another such example. Other consumer holdings saw some deterioration in underlying growth given the challenging macro backdrop, for example, quick service restaurant operator Yum China and brewer Budweiser APAC, but this was not commensurate with their declines in share prices, which signalled to us that these stocks had been oversold. As detailed in the Portfolio Activity section below, we tightened up our exposure to the Chinese consumer over the period in light of the headwinds, but retained core holdings given their quality and value. Encouragingly, towards the financial year end, we saw stabilising performance from China and Hong Kong, leading to improved overall performance of the portfolio over the final quarter. 2. Technology We had proactively built up the portfolio\\'s exposure to the technology hardware sector in anticipation of a rebound in the semiconductor cycle. Our overweight position to the sector significantly contributed to performance, as the sector rallied on a cyclical upturn in semiconductor pricing and strong demand linked to AI. Contributors included several of the Company\\'s Taiwanese holdings, namely leading passive components maker Yageo Corp and semiconductor chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSMC. Both companies posted better than expected results in the first quarter of 2024 and TSMC raised its medium term guidance thanks to the rapidly growing contribution from AIrelated demand. Elsewhere, our nonbenchmark Netherlandsbased holdings in ASML and ASM International also benefited from improved prospects in the advanced semiconductor industry. 3. India Our Indian holdings were a key driver of positive performance, accounting for 4 out of the top 10 biggest contributors. These were residential real estate developer Godrej Properties, which has been capitalising on the boom in the housing cycle in India leading life insurer SBI Life Insurance online insurance aggregator PB Fintech, and Power Grid Corporation of India which operates the majority of the electricity transmission network across the country. All four names have seen robust earnings growth tied to structural growth stories and themes within India that we believe have many years still to run. Rising affluence in India, for instance, is leading to fastgrowing premium consumption patterns in areas like financial services, automobiles, food, and personal care, while urbanisation and the current boom in infrastructure development is benefiting property developers, materials producers such as in cement, and industrial and utility plays. Portfolio Activity Throughout this turbulent macroeconomic and political period, we have continued to focus on quality companies for both their resilience and long term structural growth potential. Four key areas we wish to highlight are as follows 1. China Scaling back the consumer exposure and focusing on nearerterm cash flow generation and earnings visibility China presented us with a dilemma. On the one hand, the headwinds buffeting the Chinese consumer were strong, making life hardgoing for even the bestrun companies see Chart 4 below. On the other hand, investor sentiment towards the consumer sector and its proxies was so poor that it was also clear that many of the stocks had been oversold and were trading at very attractive valuations. Whilst we were confident that our companies would weather the storm given their superior quality, it was also difficult to pinpoint any obvious catalyst on the horizon that would trigger a rerating in the stocks. Balancing these two opposing forces, we chose to reposition the portfolio in China, reevaluating more carefully our exposure to the Chinese consumer given the obvious headwinds, whilst also retaining positions in highquality holdings with strong cash flow generation and solid nearterm earnings visibility that were trading at deeply discounted valuations. In some cases, this involved completely exiting certain names where visibility was less clear, including China Tourism Group Duty Free, GDS, Glodon and Wuxi Biologics. However, we also introduced a new name, Asia\\'s leading online travel agency Trip.com, which was benefiting from the recovery in both domestic and international travel and has a long runway for growth. Overall, our decisions resulted in a reduced exposure to China. 2. India increased exposure with new initiations across broad swathe of sectors India stands in stark contrast to China, being perhaps the most attractive macroeconomic story in the region currently, with accelerating economic growth and sound macroeconomic indicators see Chart 5 below. The dilemma for us in this market is that much of that positive story has seemingly already been priced into the market, with few quality stocks trading at attractive valuations. We have been highly cognisant of the valuation challenge, but selectively we were still able to find multiple new ideas centred on companies benefitting from the economic tailwinds and delivering robust earnings growth that underpin and support the valuations. One good example is Bharti Airtel, a leading telecom service provider with a panIndia reach and sophisticated customer base with higher than average mobile spending. The domestic telecom market has rapidly consolidated and Bharti is now capitalising on the improved economics and rising tariffs in the sector. Another example is Indian Hotels IHCL, India\\'s largest hospitality company, which is well placed to tap into the industry\\'s multiyear upcycle with improving occupancy rates and rising average room rates. We also introduced conglomerate Mahindra Mahindra, which has been delivering healthy growth in its autos business, with market share gains in the passenger vehicle business, especially within the sports utility vehicle segment. Pidilite Industries was another addition. This is a quality consumer and specialty chemicals business with leading brands in the home improvement category that will benefit from the robust recovery in the housing cycle. Conversely, we exited Kotak Mahindra Bank and Maruti Suzuki. 3. Technology Broadening exposure to the AI supply chain with a focus on Taiwan and Korea We broadened our exposure to the AI supply chain and cyclical laggards, given the positive structural growth outlook for Asia\\'s technology sector see chart 6 below. We focused on Taiwan and South Korea, which are key players in the global tech supply chain and benefiting from increased demand for semiconductors, AI and other advanced technologies. We invested in Taiwan\\'s GlobalWafers, a silicon wafer manufacturer that ranks as one of the global leaders in a consolidating industry. We introduced Yageo Corp, Taiwan\\'s leading supplier of passive components and the world\\'s third largest provider. We also added South Korea\\'s SK Hynix, the second largest DRAM and NAND manufacturer globally by revenues. We view it as well positioned and benefiting from growing demand for high bandwidth memory HBM for AI processing, such as machine learning and neural network AI. This reflects our rising conviction in the structural growth memory demand backed by AI. 4. Vietnam increased exposure to this attractive nonbenchmark growth market Finally, we increased our exposure to Vietnam, a nonbenchmark market with tremendous longterm growth potential given its young demographics, rising wealth levels and entrepreneurial spirit. More broadly, the liquidity of the stock market has improved through the years, along with market capitalisation, and this has enhanced its eligibility for the Company from a liquidity and risk perspective. The country is also emerging as an alternative supply chain option amid geopolitical uncertainties, attracting foreign direct investment in hightech sectors, especially automotive and electronics see chart 7 below. At the time of writing, we have invested in Joint Stock Commercial Bank For Foreign Trade Of Vietnam Vietcombank, which we rate as among the highest quality banks in the country, with scale, a strong deposit franchise and a good longterm track record. The bank has been able to manage through multiple cycles and deliver growth over time, too. As for fundamentals, it leads its peers in profitability and efficiency, with a higher return on equity, lower costtoincome ratio and lower cost of funding versus its domestic rivals. This is our second stock holding in Vietnam after FPT Corp. Outlook The US has elected Donald Trump as its next president, and he has also secured control of both Houses of Congress. Asset prices have moved along with a focus on the reflationary aspects of Trump\\'s preelection pledges and promises. We expect tax cuts and deregulation, but also higher tariffs. This could mean higher nominal GDP, mainly via inflation, and potentially higher for longer interest rates. We continue to monitor Trump developments closely, and higher nominal GDP growth and higherthanotherwise interest rates are the macro implications that we are most confident about for now. As for the implications for Asia, it is a complex picture. Trump is likely to drive uncertainty and volatility, but this could also create opportunities for longterm investors. Higher tariffs and barriers to trade are bad news, and this seems likely under Trump. China could be affected, and this might prompt the Chinese government to ramp up domestic economic growth efforts with aggressive stimulus measures. It is also possible that with a more transactional US President, the US and China could arrive at some mutually beneficiary agreement we should remember the first Trump presidency did see the Chinese equity market outperform. We should not ignore the risks though as unmitigated the imposition of huge tariff hikes would have a significant impact on China\\'s economy. Similarly, export markets, too, with tradeoriented countries potentially facing pressure from higher tariffs and limited rate cuts in the US. Geopolitical tensions remain difficult to navigate and whilst the world\\'s focus is on Ukraine and the Middle East, Asia could also see shifts if Trump follows a similar playbook to his first term. So, we are likely to be in for a period of change, uncertainty, and volatility across multiple fronts. Asia, however, is a diverse region and it is wrong to paint it with the same broad brush. Largely domestic driven economies like India will be insulated and may even benefit from continued supply diversification away from China. Intraregional trade continues unhindered. Asia also does not have the macro imbalances that the West is saddled with, so economies should be resilient. And there is still growth. All of which means quality companies should remain structurally well positioned. From a portfolio perspective, we believe we are wellprepared for a Trump victory due to our qualityfocused stock picking approach. We have tightened quality characteristics, adding names with greater nearterm earnings visibility and steady cash flow generation, while reducing and exiting names with less visible earnings. We have managed down our exposure to tariffrelated risks. For our China exposure, we have focused on each holding\\'s ability to defend and grow market share, expand overseas with limited tariff risks, and deliver shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. We have also reduced our technology exposure. We maintain our conviction in our holdings and their ability to navigate market crosswinds, given their quality and fundamentals. Finally, Asia remains home to some of the highest quality and most dynamic companies in the world. The region continues to offer rich pickings, underpinned by longterm structural growth trends such as the rising middle classes, rapid adoption of emerging technologies and continued urbanisation, enabling bottomup stock pickers like us to deliver sustainable returns over the long term. Pruksa Iamthongthong and James Thom abrdn Asia Limited 22 November 2024 Overview of Strategy Future of the Company Shareholders\\' attention is drawn to the Proposal for the combination with Invesco Asia Trust plc detailed under the \\'Future of the Company\\' section of the Chairman\\'s Statement and \\'Result of Review\\'.

Company Benchmark The total return of the MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan Index sterling adjusted. Alternative Investment Fund Manager \"AIFM\" The AIFM is abrdn Fund Managers Limited, aFML or the \"Manager\" which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The Company\\'s portfolio is managed on a daytoday basis by abrdn Asia Limited \"abrdn Asia\" or the \"Investment Manager\" by way of a delegation agreement. abrdn Asia and aFML are both wholly owned subsidiaries of abrdn plc. Achieving the Investment Policy and Objective The Directors are responsible for determining the investment policy and the investment objective of the Company. Daytoday management of the Company\\'s assets has been delegated to the Investment Manager. The Investment Manager follows a bottomup investment process based on a disciplined evaluation of companies through direct contact by its fund managers and analysts. Stock selection is the major source of added value. No stock is bought without the Investment Manager having first met management, either in person, where possible, or virtually. The Investment Manager evaluates a company\\'s worth in two stages quality then price. Quality is defined by reference to management, business focus, the balance sheet and corporate governance. Price is evaluated by reference to key financial ratios, the market, the peer group and business prospects. Stock selection is key in constructing a diversified portfolio of companies. A comprehensive analysis of the Company\\'s portfolio by country and by sector is disclosed on pages 39 to 41 of the published Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2024, including a description of the ten largest investments, the full investment portfolio by value, and sectorgeographical analysis. At 31 August 2024, the Company\\'s portfolio consisted of 56 holdings. Gearing is used to leverage the Company\\'s portfolio in order to enhance returns when this is considered appropriate to do so. At 31 August 2024, the Company\\'s net gearing was 6.2. Principal and Emerging Risks and Uncertainties The Board carries out a regular review of the risk environment in which the Company operates, changes to that environment and to individual risks. The Board also identifies emerging risks which might impact the Company. There are a number of other risks which, if realised, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition, performance and prospects. The most significant direct issue that the Company has faced over the year has been the impact of longterm poor relative portfolio performance. This led the Board to implement a strategic review of the Company using external advisers and this is addressed in the Chairman\\'s Statement. Beyond this, the increasing discounts to net asset value that have affected the entire investment company sector, resulting from selling pressure and lack of investor demand due to well documented cost disclosure issues and budget concerns, have heightened concerns. The Board considers the Company\\'s principal and emerging risks, which include those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency, liquidity or reputation. The Company\\'s risks have been regularly assessed by the Audit Risk Committee and managed by the Board through the adoption of a risk matrix which identifies the key risks for the Company, including emerging risks, and covers strategy, investment management, operations, shareholders, regulatory and financial obligations and thirdparty service providers. A deep dive review of the Risk Register has been performed during the year. Outwith the outcome of the strategic review, the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company, which have been identified by the Board, are described in the table below, together with mitigating actions. The Board notes that there are a number of contingent risks stemming from the global geopolitical environment that may impact the operation of the Company. Inflation and the resultant volatility that it created in global stock markets continued to be a key risk during the financial year, as well as the ongoing tensions between China and Taiwan, China and the West, and the conflagrations in the Middle East and Ukraine, all of which have created geopolitical uncertainty which further increased market risk and volatility. The Board is also conscious of the risks resulting from increasing ESG challenges. The scrutiny of human rights violations in China by Western governments is one example of the need for continued vigilance and engagement regarding supply chains and the fair treatment of workers. Likewise, as climate change pressures increase, the Board continues to monitor, through its Manager, the potential risk that investee companies may fail to maintain acceptable standards. Risk Mitigating Action Investment Risk The Company\\'s investment performance is the most critical factor to the Company\\'s longterm success. The Company is exposed to the risk of Sustained Underperformance as a result of implementing an unattractive investment strategy. The Company is exposed to the risk of Portfolio Stock Concentration as a result of the combined market share of the Manager\\'s investments. The Company is exposed to ESG Risk in the event that its investee companies act unethically, undertake environmentally detrimental practices or fail to integrate ESG factors adequately. Risk Unchanged during the year The Board continually monitors the investment performance of the Company, taking account of stockmarket factors, and reviews the Company\\'s performance compared to its benchmark index and peer group at every Board Meeting. A formal annual review is undertaken by the Management Engagement Committee. The Board has regard to the skills, depth of resources and wider capability of the abrdn group in arriving at its conclusions. In May 2024 the Board initiated a full strategic review of the Company. The results of the review were announced on 28 October 2024 and further details can be found in the Chairman\\'s Statement. The Chairman and Senior Independent Director have communicated with major shareholders, particularly with respect to the strategic review, to gauge their views on the Company, including performance. At each Board meeting the Board reviews the concentration and liquidity risk of the portfolio including the number of days required to liquidate the portfolio. The Manager undertakes extensive due diligence on each investment prior to purchase including a review of the ESG credentials. Post purchase the Manager continues to monitor and actively engage with investee company managements. Operational Risk The Company is dependent on a number of thirdparty providers, in particular those of the Manager, Depositary and Registrar. Failure by any service provider to carry out its contractual obligations could have a detrimental impact or disruption on the Company\\'s operations, including that caused by information technology breakdown or other cyberrelated issues. Risk Unchanged during the year The Board reviews the performance of the Manager on a regular basis and its compliance with the management contract formally on an annual basis. As part of that review, the Board assesses the Manager\\'s succession plans, risk management framework and marketing activities. The Audit Risk Committee reviews reports from the Manager on its internal controls and risk management including an annual ISAE Report and considers assurances from all its other significant service providers on at least an annual basis, including on matters relating to business continuity and cyber security. The Audit Risk Committee meets representatives from the Manager\\'s Compliance and Internal Audit teams on at least an annual basis and discusses any findings and recommendations relevant to the Company. Written agreements are in place with all thirdparty service providers. The Manager monitors closely the control environments and quality of services provided by third parties, including those of the Depositary, through service level agreements, regular meetings and key performance indicators. A formal appraisal of the Company\\'s main thirdparty service providers is carried out by the Management Engagement Committee on an annual basis. Governance and Regulatory Risk The Company operates in a complex regulatory environment and faces a number of regulatory risks. Serious breaches of regulations, such as the tax rules for investment companies, the FCA\\'s Listing Rules and the Companies Act. Risk Unchanged during the year The Board receives updates on relevant changes in regulation from the Manager, industry bodies and external advisers and the Board and Audit Risk Committee monitor compliance with regulations by review of internal control reports from the Manager. Directors are encouraged to attend relevant external training courses. Major Events and Geopolitical Risk The Company is exposed to supply chain risk, stockmarket volatility or illiquidity as a result of a major market shock due to a national or global crisis. The impact of such risks, associated with the portfolio or the Company itself, could result in disruption of the operations of the Company and losses. The Company is exposed to the impact of Live Conflict, sanctions and instability in the region as well as the indirect impact of global conflicts. The Company is exposed to Pandemic Risk which could result in disruption to supply chains. The Company is exposed to the risk of a major environmental event as a result of the consequences of climate change. Risk Unchanged during the year Exogenous risks over which the Company has no control are always a risk. The Company does what it can to address these risks where possible, not least operationally and to try and meet the Company\\'s investment objectives. As part of its investment processes, the Manager regularly assesses the Company\\'s portfolio as a whole, and each constituent part, and, during the financial year, remained in close communication with the underlying investee companies in order to navigate and guide the Company through macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. The Manager\\'s focus on quality companies with sustainable business models and robust finances, the diversified nature of the portfolio and a managed level of gearing all serve to provide a degree of protection in times of market volatility. The Board discusses issues affecting the region at each Board meeting and the Manager has an effective business continuity plan in place to ensure that material processes will continue to operate. The Audit Risk Committee reviews controls reports from third party service providers. The Manager undertakes due diligence on investee companies prior to and post purchase and provides updates at each Board meeting. Shareholder and Stakeholder Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of Shareholder Dissatisfaction, Activism and Influence stemming from a failure to adapt to changes in the market and investor demand. Liquidity Risk to shareholders due to share price trading at a discount to its underlying NAV and reduced investor sentiment. Risk Unchanged during the year The Board regularly monitors the marketplace for changes in sentiment. The Board regularly reviews the performance of the Company against the benchmark and peer group. The Board monitors the discount level of the Company\\'s shares against the peer group and has in place an active buyback mechanism whereby the Broker andor the Manager is authorised to buy back shares within certain limits. The Board and Manager engage regularly with shareholders to understand their views on key topics including discount volatility and shareholder views are discussed at each Board meeting. The Manager conducts extensive PR and promotional activities during the year. Shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on continuation at every fifth AGM and there is a conditional performancelinked tender offer mechanism in place. In May 2024 the Board announced its intention to undertake a strategic review of the future of the Company, including its ongoing investment management arrangements. The strategic review culminated in the announcement on 28 October 2024 of the Proposal to combine with Invesco Asia Trust plc refer to the Chairman\\'s Statement. The principal risks associated with an investment in the Company\\'s shares can be found in the preinvestment disclosure document \"PIDD\" published by the Manager, which is available from the Company\\'s website Performance Key Performance Indicators At each Board meeting, the Directors consider a number of performance measures to assess the Company\\'s success in achieving its objectives. The key performance indicators \"KPIs\" are established industry measures and are detailed below with further analysis provided in the Chairman\\'s Statement. KPI Description Net asset value and share price total return The Board monitors the NAV and share price performance of the Company over different time periods. Performance figures for one, three and five years are provided in the Results section on page 29 of the published Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2024. Performance against benchmark Performance is measured against the Company\\'s benchmark, the MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan Index in sterling terms, on a total return basis. Charts showing the Company\\'s performance against the benchmark by quarter during the financial year, and over one, three and five years, and are shown on page 30 of the published Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2024. The Board also considers peer group comparative performance over a range of time periods, taking into consideration the differing investment policies and objectives employed by those companies. DiscountPremium to net asset value The discountpremium relative to the NAV represented by the share price is closely monitored by the Board. The objective is to avoid large fluctuations in the discount relative to similar investment companies investing in the region by the use of share buy backs subject to market conditions. A graph showing the share price discount relative to the NAV is shown on page 31 of the published Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2024. Promoting the Success of the Company The Board is required to report on how it has discharged its duties and responsibilities under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 the \"s172 Statement\". Under section 172, the Directors have a duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, taking into account the likely longterm consequences of decisions, the need to foster relationships with the Company\\'s stakeholders and the impact of the Company\\'s operations on the environment. The Company consisted of five Directors at 31 August 2024 and has no employees or customers in the traditional sense. As the Company has no employees, the culture of the Company is embodied in the Board of Directors. The Board seeks to promote a culture of strong governance, high standards of business conduct and to challenge, in a constructive and respectful way, the Company\\'s thirdparty service providers and advisers, whilst considering the impact on the Company and other stakeholders. The Board\\'s principal concern has been, and continues to be, the interests of the Company\\'s shareholders and potential investors and the need to act fairly between shareholders. The Manager undertakes an annual programme of meetings with the largest shareholders and investors and reports back to the Board on issues raised at these meetings. The Investment Manager, who is based in Singapore, will attend such meetings, where possible. The Board encourages all shareholders to attend and participate in the Company\\'s AGM and shareholders can contact the Directors via the Company Secretary. Shareholders and investors can obtain uptodate information on the Company through its website and the Manager\\'s information services and have direct access to the Company through the Company Secretary. As an investment trust, a number of the Company\\'s functions are outsourced to third parties. The key outsourced function is the provision of investment management services to the Manager and other thirdparty providers support the Company by providing administration, depositary, custodial, banking and audit services. The Board undertakes a robust evaluation of the Manager, including investment performance and responsible ownership, to ensure that the Company\\'s objective of providing capital growth for its investors is met. The Board typically visits the investment region on an annual basis and meets with the Manager\\'s on the ground investment teams. This enables the Board to conduct due diligence of the fund management and research teams. During the year the Board has met with the senior management team and the fund management team and attended investee company meetings alongside the Manager. The portfolio activities undertaken by the Manager on behalf of the Company can be found in the Investment Manager\\'s Review and details of the Board\\'s relationship with the Manager and other thirdparty providers, including oversight, is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance. During the year, the Board continued to focus on the performance of the Manager in achieving the Company\\'s investment objective within an appropriate risk framework. A significant amount of time was also expended in the process of combining with abrdn New Dawn and overseeing the effective assimilation of the new assets. In addition to the Combination activities a number of key decisions have been taken by the Board during the year, including The Board appointed Stanhope Consulting to assist in a full strategic review of the future of the Company, including the ongoing investment management arrangements. The Board has declared an interim dividend of 6.6p per Ordinary share 2023 6.6p which will be paid on 31 December 2024. The Board has successfully completed its succession planning activities. The Board has continued the Company\\'s discount control policy through the buyback of shares which provides a degree of liquidity to the market at times when the discount widens. The Board continues to believe that the sensible use of modest financial gearing should enhance returns to shareholders over the longer term. As indicated in the Chairman\\'s Statement the Company has consolidated its loan facilities into a new extended revolving credit facility offering the Company short term flexibility. In summary, the Directors are cognisant of their duties under section 172 and decisions made by the Board take into account the interests of all the Company\\'s key stakeholders and reflect the Board\\'s belief that the longterm success of the Company is linked directly to its key stakeholders. Duration Shareholders\\' attention is drawn to the Proposal for the combination with Invesco Asia Trust plc which will be voted upon in early 2025 and which, if successful, will trigger the liquidation of the Company. Outwith the outcome of the Proposal, the Company does not have a fixed life, but shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on the continuation of the Company at every fifth Annual General Meeting. The last continuation vote was passed at the AGM on 15 December 2021. The frequency of continuation votes was extended from triennial continuation votes to fiveyearly continuation votes at the AGM in 2021 in order to align them with the assessment period for performancerelated conditional tender offers approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2021. The next performance related conditional tender offer will cover the period from 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2026 and the continuation vote would be due to take place at the AGM in December 2026. Board Diversity The Board\\'s statement on diversity is set out in the Statement of Corporate Governance. At 31 August 2024 there were three male Directors and two female Directors. The Company meets the target that at least one Director is from a minority ethnic background as set out in LR 6.6.6R 9aiii. Environmental, Social and Human Rights Issues The Company has no employees and therefore no disclosures are required to be made in respect of employees. More information on socially responsible investment is set out on pages 25 to 28 of the published Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2024. Viability Statement As set out in more detail in the Chairman\\'s Statement, it is proposed that the Company combines with Invesco Asia Trust plc \"Invesco Asia\". The combination, if approved by each company\\'s shareholders, will be effected by way of a scheme of reconstruction and winding up of the Company under section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and the associated transfer of part of the assets and undertaking of the Company to Invesco Asia in exchange for the issue of new ordinary shares in Invesco Asia the \"Proposal\". A circular providing further details of the Proposal and convening general meetings to approve the Proposal, and a prospectus in respect of the issue of new Invesco Asia shares in connection with the Proposal, are expected to be published in due course. The Proposal is anticipated to become effective by early 2025. The outcome of the general meetings to make the Proposal effective represents a material uncertainty in the context of the preparation of these financial statements on a going concern basis. Notwithstanding this material uncertainty, for the purposes of this viability statement, the Board has decided that five years is an appropriate period over which to report. The Board considers that this period reflects a balance between looking out over a long term horizon and the inherent uncertainties of looking out further than five years. In assessing the viability of the Company over the review period, the Directors have also focused upon the following factors The principal risks and uncertainties detailed above and the steps taken to mitigate these risks. The role of the Audit and Risk Committee in reviewing and monitoring the Company\\'s internal control and risk management systems see the Audit and Risk Committee\\'s Report on pages 58 to 60 of the published Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 August 2024. The ongoing relevance of the Company\\'s investment objective. The liquidity of the Company\\'s portfolio. All of the Company\\'s investments are in quoted securities in active markets or in collective investment schemes and are considered to be liquid. The closedended nature of the Company which means that it is not subject to redemptions. The use of the Company\\'s share buy back and share issuance policies to help address any imbalance of supply and demand for the Company\\'s shares. The current and maximum levels of gearing, compliance with loan covenants and level of headroom within the financial covenants see note 13 to the financial statements for details of loan covenants.

The level of the Company\\'s ongoing charges. The robustness of the operations of the Company\\'s third party service providers. In making its assessment, the Board has considered that there are other matters that could have an impact on the Company\\'s prospects or viability in the future, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, economic shocks, significant stock market volatility, and changes in regulation or investor sentiment. The Strategic Report has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by James Will, Chairman 22 November2024 abrdn\\'s Approach to ESG This section of the Annual Report aims to present more information on the Investment Manager\\'s ESG considerations. ESG Highlights abrdn believes that ESG considerations can meaningfully affect a company\\'s performance. abrdn has been actively integrating ESG considerations into its investment decisionmaking process for 30 years. Deep, on the ground ESG resources and expertise enables abrdn to glean insights from company visits and obtain an ESG information advantage. The Company\\'s portfolio is ESG A rated by MSCI, as is the Benchmark. A 27 109 18.1 100 Arated by MSCI ESG versus benchmark A Lower carbon intensity than the benchmark Engagements with portfolio companies during the year Average ROE of portfolio companies versus benchmark average 12.5 of abrdn researched companies include ESG analysis What is ESG? Environmental factors relate to how a company conducts itself with regard to environmental impact and sustainability. Social factors pertain to a company\\'s relationship with its employees, vendors, and a broad set of societal stakeholders. Corporate Governance factors may include the corporate decisionmaking structure, the independence of board members, treatment of minority shareholders, executive compensation and political contributions, capital allocation and the risk of bribery and corruption. abrdn is a signatory to the UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment PRI and has aligned its approach to that advocated by the PRI agenda. This aims to promote responsible investment and better management of risk. abrdn\\'s Investment Process abrdn is a pioneer in Asia Pacific markets and has a large, dedicated and highly experienced investment team consisting of approximately 40 equity investment professionals with a strong team culture. Three regional ESG specialists, supported by the Investment Manager\\'s central ESG team, work with the Asia Pacific equity team to provide insight on ESG themes and sectors in local markets. Environmental, social and corporate governance factors ESG are part of our approach to active equity investing at abrdn. abrdn believes that ESG factors are financially material and can impact a company\\'s performance, either positively or negatively. abrdn also uses its ESG approach to encourage higher standards and support companies that work towards a more sustainable and equitable world. abrdn\\'s investment process considers both macro and micro ESG issues. Macro ESG factors being broad thematic issues that impact companies and the products and services they provide, whilst micro factors are companyindustry specific issues that relate to how a company\\'s products or services are made or delivered. The Importance of Engagement Engagement is an important part of the investment process abrdn sees engagement not only as a right but as an obligation of investors. In its role as a responsible owner, abrdn engages actively and regularly with companies in which it is or may become an investor. abrdn believes that informed and constructive engagement helps to foster better companies, that can help enhance the value of investments. There are generally two core reasons for engagement to understand more about a company\\'s strategy and performance or encourage best practice and drive change. Active engagement involves regular, candid communication with management teams or boards of directors of portfolio companies to discuss a broad range of ESG issues that may impact returns, either positively or negatively. abrdn\\'s focus is on the factors which it believes to have the greatest potential to enhance or undermine an investment case. Sometimes abrdn seeks more information, exchanges views on specific issues, encourages better disclosure and at other times, encourages change including either corporate strategy, capital allocation, or climate change strategy. abrdn\\'s engagements cover a range of ESG issues, including but not limited to board composition, remuneration, audit, climate change, labour issues, human rights, bribery and corruption. Moreover, and since ESG disclosure by Asian companies is often poor, these engagements give abrdn an opportunity to source additional information and potentially to Exploit an information gap if a company does not disclose ESG information and the market is unable to form a robust view of its quality, its shares may be priced inefficiently. Using abrdn\\'s research capabilities including onsite, face to face visits, an informed view may be developed of every company helping to exploit any pricing inefficiency that is judged to exist and Close the information gap if abrdn owns a company that is misunderstood by the market, abrdn can work constructively with the company\\'s management team to encourage improved and enhanced disclosure, allowing the market to better understand, and hence better price, the company\\'s securities. ESG engagements are conducted with consideration of the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact and companies are expected to meet fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anticorruption. Engagement is not limited to a company\\'s management team. It can include many other stakeholders such as nongovernment agencies, industry and regulatory bodies, as well as activists and the company\\'s customers and clients. The Investment Manager regularly engages with companies in which the Company invests. The below shows the engagements that have included responsible investment themes, for the year to 30 June 2024. This does not include positions the Investment Manager has sold out of or is considering investing in. Below are the themes engaged during the year ESG Category Climate 8 Environment 14 Labour Management, Diversity Inclusion 20 Human Rights Stakeholders 8 Corporate Behaviour 25 Corporate Governance 34 a single meeting can have multiple topics Measurement of ESG, including abrdn\\'s Proprietary ESG Scoring System Some ESG issues can be quantified, for example the diversity of a board, the carbon footprint of a company, and the level of employee turnover. But not everything that matters can be measured. While diversity can be monitored, measuring inclusion is more of a challenge. Although it is possible to measure the level of staff turnover, it is more challenging to quantify corporate culture. Nevertheless, after researching and analysing a company, and after meeting senior management, abrdn allocates a company an ESG score of between one and five. This score of one to five is applied across every stock covered globally. Examples of each category and a small sample of the criteria used are detailed below 1. Best in class 2. Leader 3. Average 4. Below average 5. Laggard ESG considerations are material part of the company\\'s core business strategy Excellent disclosure Makes opportunities from strong ESG risk management ESG considerations not market leading Disclosure is good, but not best in class Governance is generally very good ESG risks are considered as a part of principal business Disclosure in line with regulatory requirements Governance is generally good but some minor concerns Evidence of some financially material controversies Poor governance or limited oversight of key ESG issues Some issues in treating minority shareholders poorly Many financially material controversies Severe governance concerns Poor treatment of minority shareholders abrdn also makes use of third party ESG data for two primary reasons To help build a view of a company third party ESG data provides insights into a company based on that company\\'s disclosure. Whilst that disclosure may have limits there is still merit in reading research from a speciality researcher. abrdn buys in research as a \"sense check\" against internal analysis to ensure that issues or developments are not missed or weighted incorrectly. To provide a proxy for market perspective abrdn uses third party data and scoring as a proxy for market perception and makes use of these scores to compare with internal assessments. If the market views a company as low quality and abrdn sees the company as not only higher quality but also on a positive trajectory, it may be appropriate to exploit this information asymmetry. The market may react and change perceptions over time as performance and disclosure on ESG issues improves, but abrdn is interested in the journey as much as arrival. Taking an independent view on ESG allows abrdn to anticipate upgrades and drive change through engagement. External research agencies primarily use backward looking data but through fundamental research abrdn forms a forwardlooking view of a company\\'s ESG credentials and anticipates changes, attempting to take advantage of this inefficiency. Climate Change Climate change is one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century and has big implications for investors. The energy transition is underway in many parts of the world, and policy changes, falling costs of renewable energy, and a change in public perception are happening at a rapid pace. Assessing the risks and opportunities of climate change is part of abrdn\\'s investment process. abrdn believes that climate scenario analysis provides a forward looking, quantitative assessment of the financial impact of climate risks and opportunities on the value of assets under different climate pathways. As a result, abrdn works in partnership with Planetrics to quantify the impact of climate scenarios where a probability weighted view based on a range of off the shelf and bespoke scenarios is taken. This allows abrdn to model a quantitative financial impact under 15 different climate risk scenarios at both the stock level and at the Company level. abrdn is focused on realworld decarbonisation by investing in transition leaders and climate solutions rather than the fast removal of carbon intensive companies from the portfolios it manages. abrdn engages with the highest carbonemitting companies across these portfolios through a focused priority watchlist, with a focus on clear expectations and outcomes combined with timebound milestones. Important Note The Company does not specifically exclude any sectors from its investment universe. All investments have to pass a quality test and ESG issues are only part of the investment analysis. abrdn may, for example, invest in, and vigorously engage with, a wellmanaged, capitalised and attractively valued fossil fuel company that is able to deploy a sizeable balance sheet and lower cost of capital to that of a renewablesonly alternative. It is also important to recognise that there may be periods in the future where it is impossible for abrdn to make sequential annual improvements in some ESG factors like carbon intensity. abrdn intends to maintain a lower carbon footprint relative to the benchmark but there may be times when investments are made in companies that currently have a higher footprint but have a commitment to improve this over time. abrdn will monitor and assess their commitment on a regular basis. abrdn Asia Limited 22 November 2024 Results Year\\'s HighsLows High Low Share price p 414.0 342.0 Net asset value p 462.7 397.8 Discount A 18.8 8.7 A Considered to be an Alternative Performance Measure.

Ten Largest Investments As at 31 August 2024 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Tencent Holdings As the world\\'s largest pureplay semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC provides a full range of integrated foundry services, along with a robust balance sheet and good cash generation that enables it to keep investing in cuttingedge technology and innovation. The internet giant continues to strengthen its ecosystem and we see great potential in its ability to balance its multiple revenue streams and monetise its social media and payment platforms whilst navigating the regulatory landscape. Samsung Electronics Pref AIA Group One of the global leaders in the memory chips segment, and a major player in smartphones and display panels. It has a vertically integrated business model and robust balance sheet, alongside good free cash flow generation. A leading panAsian life insurance company, it is poised to take advantage of Asia\\'s growing affluence, backed by an effective agency force and a strong balance sheet. SBI Life Insurance ASML Among the leading Indian life insurers, SBI Life\\'s competitive edge comes from a wide reach of SBI branches, highly productive agents, a low cost ratio and a reputable SBI brand. The Dutch company supplies lithography equipment that enables semiconductor chip makers to mass produce patterns on silicon, helping to make computer chips smaller, faster and greener. It earns most of its revenue from Asia. ICICI Bank Bank Central Asia India\\'s ICICI Bank has been delivering superior growth and returns improvement without compromising on asset quality. It has leveraged on its scale as well as retail and digital franchise to grow in mortgages and also grown off a low base in business banking and SMEs. Among the largest non state owned banks in Indonesia, it is well capitalised and has a big and stable base of lowcost deposits that funds its lending, while asset quality has remained solid. DBS ASM International The largest bank in Singapore, it is also the best managed with a clear strategy. It is backed by good digital infrastructure, and operates with obvious focus on efficiency of returns, as shown in the distinctively better return on equity than local peers. ASM International is the global leader in singlewafer atomic layer deposition ALD technology. ALD is a highprecision process by which smooth and ultrathin films are deposited onto a wafer. As semiconductor chips get increasingly smaller, demand for ALD is rising across the logic, foundry and memory segments and, in turn, expanding the addressable market for ASMI.

Investment Case Studies Bharti Airtel Bharti Airtel stands as one of India\\'s largest integrated telecom solutions providers, offering a wide range of services including cellularphone services, fixedline phone services, broadband, and various enterprise solutions. Additionally, it is the secondlargest mobile operator in Africa, behind South Africa\\'s MTN Group. Recently, Airtel successfully listed its Bharti Hexacom subsidiary, marking the group\\'s first IPO in over a decade. We believe Airtel is the most commercial and financially disciplined service provider in the Indian telecom sector, which has seen significant market repair in recent years. The industry has consolidated from nearly a dozen companies to just three major operators Airtel, Reliance\\'s Jio, and Vodafone Idea. Among Indian telecom operators, Airtel boasts a relatively healthy balance sheet, a strong execution track record, effective cost control, and a growing, highquality subscriber base, including approximately 259.4 million mobile smartphone customers. Due to market consolidation, Airtel achieved positive free cash flow FCF for the first time in 2022. As smartphones become more affordable and subscribers transition to 5G, the demand for data services is increasing. For Airtel, data services are experiencing rapid growth, and the company anticipates this trend to continue. Another key growth area is home broadband services, which are performing well with healthy subscriber additions, supported by the roll out of its highspeed Xstream AirFiber network across the country. Airtel has further improved the mix of its subscriber base, leading to an increase in average revenue per user ARPU and gains in revenue market share. Following the Indian parliamentary election in June, telecom operators, including Airtel, raised mobile tariffs for the first time in three years. This move aims to recoup some of the significant investments made in building India\\'s 5G technology infrastructure over the past two years. Airtel\\'s management has emphasised that tariff adjustments are essential for maintaining the industry\\'s health. The market dynamics are favourable for Airtel the number of Indian smartphone users is projected to rise from about 750 million to over a billion by 2026, driven largely by rural demand. This indicates potential for organic growth. Additionally, mobile spending as a percentage of GDP is relatively low in India compared to ASEAN markets, although many smartphone users are willing to spend 20 to 30 more on their next smartphones. On the sustainability front, Airtel continues to make progress on its ESG agenda. The company has committed to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50.2 by FY 203031 from the base year of FY 202021. It has also committed to reducing absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas GHG emissions by 42 over the same time frame. Tencent Tencent is one of China\\'s highest quality, diversified internet companies, with a deep understanding of the Chinese consumer and a highly competent management team. It is the largest operator of instant messaging and social networking services in China. Tencent\\'s integrated social platforms, such as WeChatWeixin and QQ, boast over 1.3 billion and 768 million monthly active users, respectively, dominating internet user engagement in China. This creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors and generates high user stickiness for the platform ecosystems, providing ample opportunities for Tencent to monetise its services. The largest contributor to Tencent\\'s revenue is gaming where the company holds approximately 50 of domestic market share in China. It has a collection of longrunning, popular titles that make revenue streams for the gaming business more visible. This sets the company apart from other game developers who often rely on hitormiss titles. Tencent has also built up its capabilities through mergers and acquisitions MA and licensing deals, enabling it to also grow the international gaming business. In the advertising space, Tencent has effectively monetised the massive WeChat ecosystem. It has introduced features like Moments, where users can share pictures and statuses, similar to Facebook. Recently, the company rolled out shortform videos, which have increased user engagement and created more advertising opportunities. Tencent has also been at the forefront of AI investments, monetising some of the many use cases of AI. For example, it helps advertisers create better content and make more effective ad recommendations to users. This has led to higher clickthrough rates on ads and better returns on advertising spending. Another notable tailwind for the company is the improving regulatory environment in China. In December 2023, Chinese regulators announced a wide range of rules aimed at curbing spending and rewards that encourage video games, but the government quickly backtracked on the proposal. Approval of video game titles on average have also improved, pointing to a potentially more stable regulatory landscape for Tencent. We like the company\\'s track record of strong balance sheet, its ability to fund expansion and MA activities, and its consistent free cash flow generation over the years. The company\\'s history of successful new product monetisation further underscores its longterm growth prospects. We anticipate that cash flow generation will remain relatively robust, given Tencent\\'s strong market position, revenue growth across operating segments, and significant margin expansion. In the first quarter of 2024, Tencent announced its commitment to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, emphasising that these activities will be funded by its ample cash generation. Since the postCovid reopening, the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets have experienced relative weakness due to a challenging macroeconomic environment in China. Investors have either chased shortterm trends or indiscriminately sold assets to derisk their Chinese company exposure. Despite this backdrop, Tencent has consistently performed well, owing to its longterm structural growth drivers, delivering over 22 annualised returns compared to just 8 for the MSCI China Index. Directors\\' Report Capital Structure At 31 August 2024, the Company had 157,116,517 fully paid Ordinary shares of 20p each in issue 2023 113,745,386 with a further 55,390,830 Ordinary shares of 20p held in treasury 2023 45,866,291.

Here are the five notable executive movements with outlooks for 2025. Carlos Tavares was at odds with board and overwhelmed by managing 14 brands Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares Resigns Carlos Tavares abruptly resigned Dec. 1 as CEO of Stellantis, the parent company of brands including Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, amid financial challenges and strategic disagreements. Following the move, Stellantiss management committee brought back a key executive, Tim Kuniskis, to run the vital Ram brand. John Elkann, the chairman of Stellantis, is leading an interim executive committee to head the company until a new CEO is selected in the first half of 2025. Elkann is the heir to the Agnelli family, which founded Fiat, and is also the CEO of Exor, Stellantis' largest shareholder. Two internal candidates are Antonio Filosa, CEO of the Jeep brand and COO for North America, who has experience in purchasing, manufacturing and business management and JeanPhilippe Imparato, former brands chief at Peugeot and Alfa Romeo, who was promoted to COO of the Enlarged Europe region in October. Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller must figure out a way to build awareness and consideration for Polestar Polestar Appoints New CEO Swedish EV maker Polestar appointed Michael Lohscheller, former CEO of Opel and VinFast, as its new CEO effective Oct. 1, succeeding Thomas Ingenlath, to navigate the competitive batteryelectricvehicle market. Polestar has excellent products but is a brand unknown to most BEV buyers in the U.S. The biggest challenge for Lohscheller is generating greater awareness, and that is not easy in a fragmented micromedia landscape. Hyundai CEO Jose Munoz is first nonKorean to hold the post Hyundai Promotes Jos Muoz to CoCEO Hyundai Motor Company announced in November that Global COO Jos Muoz would assume the role of global coCEO starting Jan. 1, 2025, marking the first time a foreign executive holds such a high position in the South Korean conglomerate. Munozs ascent inside Hyundai shows how valuable he is. He would be at the top of any car companys list for a new CEO, but Hyundai seems to have locked him up for the foreseeable future. Hallmark has the right experience to build global sales for the niche luxe brand Aston Martin Appoints Adrian Hallmark as CEO In March, Aston Martin named Adrian Hallmark, former CEO of Bentley, as its new chief executive to steer the luxury automaker through its next phase of development. Aston is always going to be a niche brand on the margins of the industry, but Hallmark has a track record of keeping this smallvolume brand relevant and enticing. Toyota's Jack Hollis is heading up the big expansion of hybrids in the lineup Toyota Motor North America Creates New Executive Roles In May, Toyota Motor North America restructured its leadership by creating COO and CSO roles, appointing two executive vice presidents to these positions to drive growth and advance vehicle electrification efforts. Jack Hollis, as chief operating officer, oversees Sales, Marketing, Toyota Racing Development, Product Planning, Customer Service, Manufacturing, Product Support, and Demand and Supply. Chris Reynolds, as chief strategy officer, manages Strategy and Business Development, Human Resources, Information Technology, Connected Technologies, Legal, Social InnovationDiversity Inclusion, Sustainability Regulatory Affairs, and RD. Both executives report directly to Tetsuo Ted Ogawa, CEO of TMNA. Toyota looks very strong as far as its product lineup goes, with adequate BEV offerings for the current state of BEV adoption, and is well ahead of rivals in hybrids.\"]",
