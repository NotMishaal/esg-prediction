Invest Now Ravi Samalad Morningstar India Do you feel strongly about climate change or wish to contribute to society but don’t know how to go about it? One way to achieve it is through investing in companies/mutual funds which are aligned with your values. For instance, in the US, investors who feel that they can contribute towards a cleaner environment are backing the California-based automotive firm Tesla which produces zero-emission electric cars. In investment parlance, this method of investing is known as socially responsible investing which is fast gaining popularity. Morningstar defines sustainable investing as a long-term approach that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process. Responsible investment does not require ruling out investment in any sector or company. It simply involves including ESG information in investment decision-making keeping. The acceptance for responsible investing is gaining ground. According to the 2014 Nielsen Global Survey of Corporate Social Responsibility, more than half of consumers surveyed globally said they would be willing to pay more for products and services from companies committed to positive social and environmental impact. Two-thirds said they would prefer to work for a socially responsible company. When it comes to investing, a recent Morgan Stanley survey found 71% of respondents indicated they were interested in sustainable investing. Investors increasing focus on ESG is evident by the growth in ESG assets globally. According to a McKinsey report, ESG assets totaled USD 22 trillion across Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe and the US at the start of 2016. There are 187 US-listed open-end funds and ETFs in this space, with total assets of USD 75 billion. Internationally, institutional investors who practice ESG investing include Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), and the Dutch pension fund ABP. In the UK, defined schemes are expected to grow six-fold to £1.7trn by 2030 and the UK government is considering issuing guidelines on adopting socially responsible investing. Many asset managers and retirement funds across the globe have committed to socially responsible investing by being signatories to the United Nations supported network of investors called Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The PRI works with its international network of signatories to put the six Principles for Responsible Investment into practice. Its goals are to understand the investment implications of environmental, social and governance issues and to support signatories in integrating these issues into investment and ownership decisions. Back in India, ESG is still a niche market. That said, the government and SEBI has recognized the importance of adopting responsible business practices in the interest of the social set-up. In fact, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs came out with the 'National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business' in 2011. From 2012, the top 100 listed companies according to market capitalization are disclosing Business Responsibility Reports in their annual reports. The size of the ESG linked investments in India is pegged to be USD 30 billion and estimated to touch USD 240 billion in next 10 years, as per cKinetics. So how do you go about making socially responsible investing? There are two ways to investing in companies which score high on ESG – buying the stock directly or through mutual funds. In India, there are a handful of socially responsible funds such as Tata Ethical Fund, Taurus and Reliance ETF Shariah BeES which follow the moral codes of Shariah law while investing. For instance, the Shariah law does not permit investing in companies dealing in alcohol, weapons, gambling and so on. While these funds are around for a long time, they are yet to catch investors fancy. Morningstar has been helping investors make an informed decision while looking to invest in such funds through its The Morningstar Sustainability RatingTM in developed markets. It is a measure of how well the holdings in a portfolio are managing their environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, risks, and opportunities relative to their Morningstar Category peers. In 2016, Morningstar has launched its Morningstar India Sustainability Index which ranks companies as per their ESG score. Technology companies like Wipro, Infosys and Tech Mahindra had the highest ESG score in the Morningstar India Sustainability Index. This can be a good starting point for Indian bourses filter their socially responsible investing choices. Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange also have ESG indices which can help investors screen such companies. Going ahead, the ESG market is expected to grow rapidly as investors across the globe grow conscious of issues such as environment, workplace policies, product safety, and the global supply chain.

         "Refresher on Responsible Investing More from this feature A major tipping point for RI? Asset-management companies increasingly are integrating environmental, social and corporate governance factors into the selection and management of investments as investors’ interest in responsible investing grows By: Leah Golob Source : Investment Executive January 15, 2018 November 9, 2019 00:09 Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Mail to a fried Print Leah Golob As Canadians strive to align their investments with their environmental and social values, asset-management firms are likely to ramp up their focus on responsible investing (RI) in the year ahead to meet clients’ evolving needs. “We’re seeing a growing product landscape for RI,” says Dustyn Lanz, CEO of the Responsible Investment Association (RIA) in Toronto. “In a decade or so, I think we’re going to look back to today as a major tipping point for RI in Canada.” Interest in RI has risen sharply in recent years. In fact, assets under management (AUM) in RI increased by 50% to $1.5 trillion in 2015 from $1 trillion in 2013, according to the RIA’s 2016 Canada RI Trends Report. Although most of the growth in RI came from institutional investors, AUM from individual investors has grown even more acutely (by 91%) to $118.5 billion during this time. Also read Refresher on Responsible Investing Much of this growth in AUM occurred because more asset-management firms are integrating environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors into the selection and management of investments, according to the RIA’s report. In fact, ESG integration now is the leading RI strategy in Canada, whereas shareholder engagement previously was the most prominent RI strategy in Canada. “Interest in sustainability will continue to grow because the world’s sustainability challenges will continue to grow,” says J.P. Harrison, president of Vancouver-based Genus Capital Management Inc., which introduced its first ESG portfolios in 1994. “As a result, the [asset-management] industry will continue to do more sustainable investing and will continue to learn more about ESG issues and how to incorporate those into their investment approaches.” Toronto-based RBC Global Asset Management Inc. (RBCGAM) is one asset-management firm that’s focusing more on ESG. The company plans to ensure its investment teams employ an ESG strategy when selecting investments. “We’re not eliminating companies from the investment universe,” says Jason Milne, vice president of corporate governance and RI at RBCGAM, in Toronto. “We’re making sure that we understand the ESG risks that we’re taking on in our portfolios and that we’re managing those risks. It’s ESG integration across all of what we do.” Although this RBCGAM initiative began in 2014, Milne says, the firm plans to spend the next year formalizing the process and working with investment teams to ensure they have the necessary research and support. The reasons that large, global asset-management firms are taking ESG factors into account when selecting investments is clear: there’s growing recognition among academic research and asset managers that doing so is not injurious to financial returns, says Doug Morrow, associate director of thematic research in Toronto with Sustainalytics, an Amsterdam-based firm specializing in ESG research. Instead, companies that score well in ESG criteria are considered better equipped to manage risks related to trends such as water scarcity, climate change and gender diversity. “[RI] has really shifted from an ethical concern to this idea that companies that perform well on ESG metrics make better long-term financial bets,” Morrow adds. One of the challenges RI will face in the year ahead is ESG data disclosure from publicly traded companies. Many fail to release metrics on greenhouse-gas emissions, energy consumption and payroll data, Morrow says. Still, the trend toward adopting an ESG strategy in selecting investments is expected to continue unabated, and Lanz predicts that topics such as gender diversity, climate change, executive compensation, cannabis, cybersecurity and other technology-related trends, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, will receive greater scrutiny this year from asset-managers. Furthermore, water management, especially in mining and textile industries, also will receive much greater focus in the year ahead, Morrow says: “We expect to see a real uptick in the amount of water infrastructure that’s being financed over the short term.” In addition to ESG integration, impact investing is another trend likely to gain momentum in the year ahead. This strategy seeks to generate a social return alongside a financial return by devoting capital to ventures that aim to produce social or environmental benefits. “Impact investing [suggests], ‘I want to make capital more plentiful to those who are trying to improve the world’,” Harrison says. “I see [this factor] really growing, largely because it’s more positive and inspirational. It’s about being a part of the solution.” As a result, large asset managers are considering their approach to impact investing. Says Jamie Jenkins, head of the responsible global equities team with Toronto-based BMO Global Asset Management: “We’re looking at what we want to contribute to the impact investing space and [asking ourselves if] we need new funds to make that contribution.” But while asset-management firms will focus on their products and investment approaches in the year ahead to meet the growing demand for RI, the RIA will be making education a top priority for 2018. The RIA plans to launch an online platform on which investors can find advisors who focus on RI, as well as find RI products and services.

         "Press Releases Corporate Responsibility CDL receives global recognition for gender diversity and sustainability https://www.eco-business.com/press-releases/cdl-receives-global-recognition-for-gender-diversity-and-sustainability/ Copy Published by City Developments Limited Jan. 24, 2018 Only real estate management and development company in inaugural sector-neutral 2018 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index Longest-running Singapore-based company on the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World City Developments Limited (CDL) has joined over 100 companies from ten sectors headquartered in 24 countries and regions in the inaugural sector-neutral 2018 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI). Launched on 22 January 2018, the reference index measures gender equality across internal company statistics, employee policies, external community support and engagement, and gender-conscious product offerings. CDL is the only real estate management and development company named in the GEI. [1] Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are honoured to be the only real estate management and development company selected for the 2018 Bloomberg GEI. We have always believed in the importance of gender diversity and strived hard to make it part of our corporate culture and inherent within our workforce.” “In doing so, it has enabled us to benefit hugely from the unique perspectives and immense creativity which different individuals across both genders bring to the table. By harnessing the diversity of our talent pool represented by different genders, age groups, ethnicities, cultures, geographies and backgrounds, it has given us a strong strategic advantage when it comes to decision-making and operations. With women making up about 70 per cent of CDL’s workforce and 40 per cent of our department heads, we are committed to empowering women in our workplace and supporting their pursuit for career and personal development.” Recognising that creating and expanding opportunities for women are fundamental to sustainable growth and beneficial to society at large, CDL established an internal Diversity and Inclusion Task Force in 2017 to promote awareness and adoption of diversity and inclusion within the organisation and the larger community. CDL has also adopted a formal Board Diversity Policy which sets out a clear policy and framework for promoting diversity on its Board. At the launch of its Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA), the eco-developer initiated Women4Green, the first Singapore network for women in sustainability. The network aims to celebrate, inspire and empower women to create a financially, environmentally and socially sustainable future. In addition, Mr Kwek joined over 1,600 leaders globally in pledging support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles. Developed through a partnership between by the UN Women and UN Global Compact, the principles offer practical guidance to the private sector on how to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. Mr Kwek is also a member of the Diversity Action Committee (DAC) initiated by the Singapore Exchange that aims to advocate for an increase in women directors on listed company boards in Singapore for the sustainable competitiveness of companies and the economy as a whole. CDL supports the DAC’s recommendations and has established a Board Diversity Policy even when there is no regulatory requirement to do so. Besides the GEI, CDL emerged on 23 January 2018 as the longest-running Singapore-based company to be listed on the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World, underscoring its unwavering conviction and commitment to sustainability. It is the first and only Singapore company to be on the index for nine consecutive years. Conducted by Corporate Knights, a Toronto-based international media and investment research firm, the Global 100 ranking is recognised as the world’s preeminent sustainability equity index and gold standard in corporate sustainability analysis. Announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Global 100 companies on the 2018 ranking were selected from a pool of 5,994 publicly listed companies—each evaluated on a set of up to 17 environmental, social and governance indicators relative to their industry peers using publicly available information. This year’s methodology also included a new weighting system based on an impact algorithm and a green revenue indicator. [2] Ms Esther An, CDL Chief Sustainability Officer, said, “Climate change and environmental threats have significant impacts across sectors and regions, and businesses can no longer ignore the risks posed on their bottom line. From a very early stage, CDL has recognised this and for more than two decades, sustainability has been strategically integrated into our business and operations.” “Amidst growing global uncertainty and an ever-evolving business landscape, CDL has continued to innovate our product and services by leveraging our green building track record to enhance financial performance. We are poised to stay dynamic and resilient in delivering lasting value for our business, investors, stakeholders and the environment at large.” “Building on our firm foundation in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) management, we established the CDL Future Value 2030 blueprint in 2017. This is a forward-looking action plan with clear long-term ESG goals and targets to guide CDL towards 2030—a milestone year for global sustainable development, climate agreement and green building movement. Furthermore, we have aligned these goals and targets to support ten relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.” As part of the CDL Future Value 2030 blueprint, the company made a bold move to raise its carbon emissions intensity reduction target from 25 per cent to 38 per cent by 2030 against 2007 levels. The enhanced target adopts the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach, a sector-based target-setting methodology, to support Singapore’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, Climate Action Plan and Sustainable Singapore Blueprint. The Singapore government has designated 2018 as the Year of Climate Action. As the pioneer and forerunner in sustainability, CDL is honoured to co-host the official launch of the Year of Climate Action with the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, which will take place at the zero-energy SSA on 26 January 2018. Located at CDL’s City Square Mall, the SSA is a joint initiative by CDL and the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore in support of global and national goals to tackle climate change. In view of the global move towards a circular economy, CDL has also established new targets to reduce its total waste disposed by 50 per cent from 2016 levels, and to ensure that 50 per cent of its construction materials are derived from recycled content, low-carbon sources or certified by recognised environmental organisations. Mr Michael Yow, Research Director, Corporate Knights said, “The Global 100 companies make up the top 1.6% in sustainability performance of corporations with revenue of at least US$1 billion. Due in part to methodology changes, there has been a high turnover in this year’s ranking. CDL’s long and continued standing in the ranking is a testament to its leadership in sustainability performance.” For its steadfast sustainability efforts and performance, CDL is consistently listed on 13 leading global sustainability benchmarks including FTSE4Good Index Series (since 2002), MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes (since 2009), Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World (since 2010) and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (since 2011). In October 2017, CDL emerged as the highest scoring Singapore real estate company for its climate change response to CDP. A non-profit environmental disclosure platform, CDP recognised CDL as one of four companies in the Hong Kong and Southeast Asia region to have attained Leadership level for its 2017 climate disclosure. In September 2017, CDL was also named the Regional Sector Leader for the Office Sector in Asia in the 2017 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) released. It was ranked first out of 31 participants in this category of the leading ESG benchmark for real estate sector. GRESB’s investor members, representing over US$17 trillion in institutional capital, use GRESB data to better manage ESG risks and enhance returns of their real asset investments worldwide. That same month, CDL was accorded ‘Best Sustainability Report for Established Reporters (Mainboard and Catalist)’ at the inaugural Singapore Sustainability Reporting Awards 2017.

         "This article first appeared in Personal Wealth, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on January 1, 2018 - January 7, 2018 “I am all for the environment, society and good governance, but I don’t want to sacrifice investment returns.” Since Morningstar launched an initiative around sustainable investing in 2016, this is by far the most common objection we have encountered. Sceptics, especially in Asia, should be encouraged by the results of a recent study we conducted into the performance of the Morningstar Sustainability Index Family. As background, those indices include the highest scoring publicly listed equities within various regions on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Morningstar sources ESG ratings from Sustainalytics, a specialist research firm, which assesses companies relative to their global industry peers. Our sustainability indices do not necessarily exclude objectionable industries. Rather, they emphasise companies that are following global best practices on ESG factors. Of the 20 indices in the Sustainability family, 16 have outperformed their non-sustainable counterparts over their life span. The Asia-focused Sustainability indices — Asia, Asia ex-Japan, Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia, Asia-Pacific ex-Japan and broad Emerging Markets — all beat their mainstream counterparts. The differentials tend to be small, but that is by design. Sector and country weights are deliberately constrained to provide market-like exposure. Let’s take an example. The Asia-Pacific Sustainability index’s superior performance is due to being above-market weight in stocks such as Tencent, Taiwan Semiconductor and the Australian banks. We have also observed that the companies favoured by the Sustainability Index Family generally tend to score well on measures of financial health, volatility and competitive positioning. This supports the theory that companies that pay attention to ESG criteria are acting in their own self-interest. Using less energy is not just good for the earth, it also saves money. Treating your workforce well is a way to attract and retain talent. An independent board of directors provides an important check on corporate managers. As for Malaysia, its public-listed companies lag regional leaders Australia and Taiwan on ESG criteria, not to mention Europe — the world leader in sustainability. That said, the Malaysian market boasts a superior ESG profile to that of mainland China and Singapore. Public Bank Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd are all considered ‘average performers’ when compared to their global industry peers on an ESG basis. MISC Bhd is considered an ‘outperformer’. Studies show that women and younger investors care most about sustainability. As these demographic segments gain more control of wealth, demand for ESG-minded investments is likely to grow. But our study shows that paying attention to ESG is as much about value as values. After many years of strong equity market returns across regions, share prices look lofty. Morningstar’s Investment Management group believes that valuations going into 2018 limit return potential for equities. The US markets concern them most, followed by developed Europe and Asia. They see emerging market stocks returning an average of 6.6% per annum over the next 10 years, with considerable volatility likely. Portfolios of profitable, financially strong, durable companies — the kind that score well on environmental, social and governance criteria — may serve investors well over the years ahead. All the while, sustainable investments will be contributing to a world of lower carbon emissions, greater inclusiveness and better corporate stewardship.

         "Advertisement Regulation Business Companies Why Hong Kong firms need to do better on environment, social and governance risks disclosure KPMG says Hong Kong listed companies must step up their game when it comes to mandatory disclosure on environment, social and governance risks Reading Time: 3 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Eric Ng Published: 12:09pm, 7 Jan 2018 Updated: 5:31pm, 3 Jul 2018 The quality of the first mandatory disclosure by Hong Kong listed firms on their environment, social and governance performances leaves a lot to be desired and is far from sufficient to help investors make informed decisions, according to a recent survey. Advertisement The findings from a review by audit and consulting firm KPMG showed a low regard for ESG risks as principal risks, unclear board engagement in ESG governance and poor disclosure on whether and how companies identified risks that were most relevant to them. The survey revealed that most companies were at an early stage of the ESG journey. “Many have yet to demonstrate awareness of the significant ESG risks they are exposed to and the effective management of their impacts,” said the KPMG report, which was issued in November. In its survey of the annual and ESG reports of 366 firms – around a quarter of all firms listed in Hong Kong, KPMG found only 16 per cent had identified one or more ESG risks as principal risks in their business reviews. Advertisement “The financial sector had the lowest rate of ESG risk disclosure … this is surprising given the growing environmental and social risks facing the clients [or] investees,” KPMG said.

         "Leadership Leadership Strategy Yes, Larry Fink Is Talking To You. Here's What To Do About It. By Nell Derick Debevoise , Senior Contributor. My Lead in 3D framework helps leaders reach Me, We, and World goals. Follow Author Jan 26, 2018, 01:03pm EST Save Article This article is more than 7 years old. As the world’s largest investor, Larry Fink’s opinion gets noticed. But this week, everyone missed his point, at their own peril. Fink’s essential point is that “a company’s ability to manage environmental, social, and governance matters demonstrates the leadership and good governance that is so essential to sustainable growth, which is why we are increasingly integrating these issues into our investment process.” And developing this ability to manage ESG matters rests not with the CEOs he addressed, but the hundreds of thousands of people who work for them. This mandate provides huge opportunity for those of us looking to build more meaning into our work, whether in our current role or the next one. Larry Fink's emphasis on environmental, social and governance matters must engage all employees (AP ... [+] Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Fink is not suggesting that “companies need to do more than make profits, as Andrew Ross Sorkin put it. He is not trying to run the NYSE or “play God,” as Sam Zell accused . He’s outlining the investment strategy that his – the largest in the world, remember – firm will take in 2018. Corporate leaders, board members and investment analysts are invited to respond accordingly if they want to retain BlackRock’s capital and support. Here’s the thing: the CEOs to whom this letter was sent yesterday are actually quite limited in their ability to “manage environmental, social, and governance matters”. They can express their commitment to these matters, explain how they enhance the firm’s strategic competitive advantage , or paint company values on office walls. But the actual execution and management of the components of ESG matters are hiring, sourcing, distribution, and those things are all done by employees and mid-level managers. So, if you are an employee or manager, or serve as an investment analyst that evaluates corporations, Larry Fink is talking to you. And leaders and boards: this bottom-up approach to heeding Fink’s advice represents a huge opportunity to reverse the disengagement and churn that's costing you so much money . So if you haven't yet, forward that letter to your entire organization . This mandate for all corporate employees and investment sector professionals, to pay attention to environmental, social, and governance matters presents an opportunity. The opportunity is to engage the American workforce, from the bottom up, in the inspiring challenge of addressing the problems we have a collective interest in solving. Such engagement will stem the expensive churn of employees, recapturing the $450-550 billion dollars of annual losses attributed to worker disengagement and raising stagnant productivity levels . Employees inspired by their firms’ larger purpose are 225% more productive than those who are merely satisfied with their work . As any worthwhile opportunity, this one comes with some responsibility. The good news is that we have the tools required to carry out those responsibilities and benefit our companies, communities, and ourselves. So what to do on Monday morning? The first step is to make sure that you have a grasp on which environmental, social, or governance matters are most salient to your work, and perhaps even more importantly, to you personally. What topics do you care most about, and which of those touch your work? There are plenty of problems to go around, so there’s no sense forcing yourself to work on things that don’t turn you on. And indeed, you’ll never reach your full potential if you don’t align your personal sense of purpose priorities with your work . If you’re not sure what exactly Fink means by “environmental, social, and governance matters,” Wikipedia is a great place to start. The CFA Institute has some great resources for those looking to dig deeper. Once you’ve done some research and reflection, help those around you to do the same. Ask your employees what they care about, and help them connect those issues to your team’s work, or your firm’s overall goals. Talk to your manager about how she thinks about the connection between her personal sense of purpose and the work your team contributes to at the firm. This process doesn’t have to be highly formalized or scientific – perfect is the enemy of the good, and ESG guidelines are far from perfected at this point. It’s just important that you’re helping your team connect the dots between what they care about and how the company “[responds] to broader societal challenges,” in Fink’s words. If you want some structure, try this simple Mission Statement exercise . And then finally, there is a responsibility to measure your firm’s performance on ESG matters. This is no easy task, yet at least. Rating agencies are competing to establish go-to ESG rankings. Some investors are making their own standards. And the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board is working on integrating ESG factors into firms’ annual reporting. An interesting tool to build a firm that customers and employees love is the JUST Rankings, published annually based on a poll of what issues the American people care about . This approach is well-matched to the bottom-up, individual-level nature of the change required to actually improve companies’ ESG performance. CEOs and board members can state their commitment to sustainability and community responsibility, or comply with rating agencies’ processes. But it’s individual employees who must understand how their roles affect ESG matters, and get excited and be allowed to change their work accordingly. And yet, how many CEOs forwarded Fink’s letter to their full organizations yesterday? If they didn’t, they missed a hugely valuable opportunity. Paul Polman, the beacon of corporate sustainability, tweeted an article by an Aspen Institute VP, explaining that Fink wants “business to pay attention to the unintended costs of doing business and changing social norms, and to be bold in a time of low trust and a glaring disconnect between ‘value’ and values,” which is exciting. But “business” can’t do those things, people can. So, each of our personal responsibility is to identify the ESG factors we and our teams care about, connect those to improving our firm’s work, and then measure our performance. Those of us who accept that responsibility, and start somewhere, will enhance our productivity and satisfaction at work. Managers who support their teams to do the same will benefit from a market-winning improvement in performance. And that’s what underlies the investment thesis of the world’s largest investor. As the world's largest investor, Fink's emphasis on ESG matters is an important call to ...

         "New sustainability index will facilitate sustainable investment in Europe Solactive, a leading German company in the indexing industry, has partnered with Deutsche Bank to launch the new Solactive Sustainability Index Europe- a tool designed to track the performance of environmentally and socially responsible European companies. 26 January 2018 Websolutions Solactive, a leading German company in the indexing industry, has partnered with Deutsche Bank to launch the new Solactive Sustainability Index Europe- a tool designed to track the performance of environmentally and socially responsible European companies. The new index will use Arabesque S- Ray®, a data-driven platform which combines first-of-its-kind machine-learning and algorithm-based technology to rate companies based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact: Human Rights, Labour Rights, the Environment, and Anti-Corruption. Timo Pfeiffer, Head of Research at Solactive AG, explained: “The Solactive Sustainability Index Europe allows investors to gain access to ESG-compliant companies, while minimising the overall portfolio risk, achieved thanks to volatility optimisation”. “We are thus combining two of the most sought-after concepts in capital markets with a clear value-add for investors. We look forward to continuing to work with our clients and partners to expand the Solactive ESG offering”, he continued. Andreas Feiner, Head of ESG Research at Arabesque, added that “more than ever before, investors are asking for greater transparency around the sustainability of the companies they invest in” arguing that the new ESG data aggregator tool and the sustainability index will be of great value to investors. The Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Criteria is a set of standards evaluating a company’s operations. Investors interested in sustainable and socially responsible investment use these criteria to screen future investments. One of the most common ways to apply ESG is to evaluate the climate risks to which a company is exposed to and threaten their future income. Institutional investors, most commonly asset managers, pension funds and private banks are incorporating ESG into their investment strategies to accelerate climate action in the financial system. Climate Action proudly launches the Sustainable Investment Forum Europe this year, taking place in Paris 13 March .

         "Vision Super has reduced the carbon intensity of its portfolio and implemented other environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures over the last year, according to its latest corporate responsibility report which was released today. Vision Super said that reducing its portfolio’s carbon footprint both reflected the fund’s responsibility to members and protected their investments. “As a values-based fund, we believe we have a responsibility to act on members’ environmental and ethical concerns,” Stephen Rowe, Vision Super chief executive said. Super funds deliver stellar performance in November, latest data shows Decade of deficits looms amid ‘unavoidable’ spending “Last year, we took further action to reduce the carbon intensity of our equities portfolios, because we believe that it is vital to safeguarding our members’ retirement savings.” Vision Super also implemented a range of operational decisions to reduce their carbon footprint, such as replacing its car fleet with more carbon efficient vehicles and reducing paper use and waste. Rowe said that the fund’s ESG efforts were not limited to solely environmental issues, as social and environmental problems were intertwined. “We consider issues like tax policy, wages, trade unionism, child labour – which are all part of our holistic ESG decision-making framework that informs all of our investment decisions as a values-based fund,” he said. Vision Super had previously been recognised as the fourth largest responsible investor in Australia by the Responsible Investment Benchmark Report in 2016, and was ranked 19 th out of the world’s 500 largest investors for action on climate change in the 2017 Global Climate Index by the Asset Owners Disclosure Project. Delahunty has issued a fairly stern response to ASIC, defending super’s investments in private markets and urging the regulator to work with APRA to eliminate “duplicative regulatory requests”. As super funds and private equity firms ramp up take-private deals, shrinking the ASX, the corporate watchdog is on high alert, especially with global consensus suggesting that the next financial crisis could stem from private markets. Australian super funds are expected to invest trillions of dollars in international markets by 2035, with the US emerging as the top destination for these funds, according to a new report commissioned by IFM Investors.

         "Neuberger blasts credit agencies over ESG failings By Kristen McGachey , 9 Jan 18 “Much more needs to be done” by the big three credit ratings agencies to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns into their issuer ratings, according to Neuberger Berman. The investment manager said that Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch must create a standardised method for analysing ethical topics and push for greater transparency in order to better integrate ESG factors into their credit rating assessments. Neuberger Berman’s criticisms come after a roundtable discussion held at its global headquarters in New York alongside the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), attended by a dozen asset managers and representatives from S&P and Moody’s. Fitch did not send a company representative to the feedback session. The investment manager has been collaborating with the PRI since 2015 to encourage credit agencies to better systematically incorporate ESG characteristics into their issuer ratings. One of the major shortcomings identified in the panel discussion was the absence of a systematic methodology for evaluating ESG concerns and risks within the credit analysis process. While S&P and Moody’s have taken steps to integrate ESG concerns into their assessments of credit risk, with S&P referencing management of issues like the environment and climate as far back as 2012, Jonathan Bailey, head of ESG investing at Neuberger Berman, argued these measures are not enough. “We have yet to see a credit rating agency publish a transparent and detailed methodology for analysing ESG considerations as part of their credit analysis methodology across industries,” said Bailey. “Investors and issuers need clarity on what factors credit analysts specifically review for each industry and we believe that analysts should use a common investor-oriented framework like the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) as the starting point for their work.” Fitch, meanwhile, has not yet provided any kind of quantitative review of ratings decisions involving ESG comparable to S&P’s and has not signed on to the PRI’s credit rating initiative. Although it has stated in recent weeks that it considers ESG risk in its credit ratings, by its own admission “it is rare for ESG risk to be the main driver of credit risk or a rating action”. A long way to go Other highlighted areas of concern were a lack of transparency on how ESG considerations impact credit ratings, and a failure on the part of the credit agencies to name and shame issuers who are not providing sufficient disclosure of material ESG topics. The trio of firms were also called out for not being proactive enough when it comes to flagging ESG risks that require greater attention from issuers and investors. Involvement from the big three credit rating agencies is paramount in pushing the ESG agenda forward because these firms are crucial in “establishing de facto standards for disclosure by issuers,” according to Bailey. “By taking these steps, credit rating agencies can help well-managed issuers with strong ESG performance differentiate themselves from their less well-managed industry peers. Academic research suggests this may be associated with lower direct borrowing costs as well as lower stock price synchronicity, which is associated with lower cost of capital for issuers overall. “More importantly, this sort of action will also help support the effective, efficient and reliable operations of the capital markets as a whole by reducing systematic risk and improving capital allocation,” he continued. “We look forward to continuing to work with our partners at the PRI to engage with credit rating agencies on this important issue.” Tags: ESG | Neuberger Berman Share this article Related Stories Investment Marlborough appointed ACD for new Boolers funds Africa William Blair IM launches EM frontier debt SICAV fund Companies Utmost Wealth Solutions AUM surpass £100bn Investment FCA fines trader Mako £1.6m for systems and controls failures"

         "Money Personal Finance BlackRock To Executives: Serve A Social Purpose, Or Bust By Alap Shah , Former Contributor. Jan 23, 2018, 01:19pm EST Save Article This article is more than 7 years old. A general view of the U.K. headquarters of BlackRock on January 26, 2017 in London, England. (Photo ... [+] by Jack Taylor/Getty Images) With last week’s bold announcement by Laurence Fink , founder and chief executive of BlackRock, we thought it’d be a perfect time to show you how to search for the CSR initiatives of public companies within Sentieo. Last week, the executives of many large public companies received a letter from Fink which suggested that they not only make profits for shareholders, but also that they engage in social good if they desire the backing of BlackRock: “Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” ( NY Times ) With climate change, workplace culture, and data security making headlines recently, we wanted to see how much companies are really discussing corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental social governance (ESG). We did a quick search in Sentieo to find mentions of these themes in earnings calls transcripts, press releases, presentations, and sustainability disclosures (blue bars below), as well as keyword mentions on Twitter (red line below). Mentions of \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" Sentieo There has been a drastic increase in public companies’ focus on “social good” topics over last 10 years, mirrored by a parallel jump in Twitter mentions. We expect this trend to only continue in the next few years as announcements like BlackRock’s become more common, and companies take a closer look at contributing to sustainability projects, growing workplace diversity, and giving back to their communities. A few well-known companies appearing in our search results that are already incorporating corporate social responsibility into their future plans are: Hasbro (HAS), Cisco (CSCO), and Herman Miller (MLHR). Check out one of Hasbro’s press releases below: Hasbro Press Release Sentieo Cisco (CSCO) also had a full report on 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility: Cisco Presentation Sentieo We also used Sentieo Plotter to plot the mentions of “corporate social responsibility” across Cisco’s documents over the last 10 years (red), Cisco’s stock price (blue) and Twitter mentions of “corporate social responsibility” (green). All three have steadily increased over time. Cisco Mentions of CSR Sentieo As both consumers and investors take a more critical eye to how products and services are created and delivered — demanding full transparency — public companies will need to take an honest, internal look at their social impact and how it will affect their ability to succeed in the future.

         "This article first appeared in Personal Wealth, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on January 8, 2018 - January 14, 2018 Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) and sustainable investing (SI) are central topics for policymakers, institutional investors and corporates. Related stories - be it human rights, board diversity or climate change - appear daily in the media. Major institutions and, increasingly, younger retail investors are keenly focused on these issues and managers are factoring the concepts into their investment strategies. In short, ESG and SI are no longer outliers to the portfolio selection and investment process. The investment landscape has been rewritten of late, with all the players in the investment value chain shifting their focus to long-term, sustainable, risk-adjusted returns. This is a key global trend, with worldwide responsible investment assets as at the end of 2016 amounting to nearly US$23 trillion, says the 2016 Global Sustainable Investment Review. In Asia-Pacific, the responsible investment trend has seen spectacular growth, with China and India’s doubling between 2014 and 2016. Indeed, China has grown rapidly to become the largest issuer of green bonds globally, accounting for 40% of all new green bonds. In 2017, BNP Paribas conducted a study on ESG practices in Asia-Pacific and globally with over 450 investors, accounting for over US$5.4 trillion in assets under management. The results underline the importance of ESG — in the next two years, 46% of asset owners plan to have 50% or more of their investments in funds that incorporate ESG or responsible investing, and 54% of asset managers plan to market 50% or more of their funds as ESG or responsible investing funds. We also found that investors are increasingly investing based on the ESG profiles of the investee companies (57% of respondents) and using green, sustainable bonds (52%). Asia-Pacific investors are leapfrogging their regional counterparts, with the Paris Agreement of 2015 hugely important in focusing attention on Asia on green and low-carbon growth and in spurring environmental and social investing. “In many Asian countries, it is no longer regarded as something that is ‘nice to have’, but instead, regulation and policy development is placing the region on a trajectory that will see it soon overtake other parts of the world,” states the Responsible Investment Market Update: A Snapshot of Signatory Action, Principles for Responsible Investment. Asia-Pacific respondents in our survey were particularly positive about ESG. They are more likely to have an ESG policy as part of their strategy (92%) and incorporate ESG factors into decision making (84%). Despite these positive developments, there is still much work to do and challenges to overcome. Action is required in three key areas: Smarter data, better analytics Our respondents noted that a lack of robust ESG data is the biggest issue for asset owners and asset managers, with over 55% of them citing this as the biggest challenge. ESG and long-term sustainable value creation is not just about the past and the present, but about the future as well; the emphasis has to be on developing more rigorous and granular analytics and stress-testing capabilities. This will assist the investment decision-making processes, bolster risk management practices and demonstrate long-term performance benefits. A common language If investors are to make more informed and transparent decisions, they need to understand every ESG-related risk and opportunity associated with the companies and sectors in which they invest. According to our survey, the biggest reason why ESG is not part of investment decision-making today is a lack of clarity over how to define it — an obstacle for 38% of the respondents who do not currently incorporate ESG into their investment decisions. Hence, a common language to enable richer, deeper and more comprehensive reporting of the risks and the opportunities is something the industry at large is working towards. In November last year, with the rapid growth of the green bond market, the European Investment Bank and the China Green Finance Committee presented the initial conclusions of a project that ultimately seeks to facilitate the establishment of a common language in green finance. The organisation’s study looked in detail at the green bond standards in China and the European Union, finding that they use different categories to classify underlying assets. Governance and standards ESG goes beyond just the investor or the corporate. It impacts all aspects of the investment value chain. Regulators and industry bodies as well have a strong role to play, be it in the realm of governance codes, Stewardship codes, the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) guides, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards or with standards on green bonds. With the launch of the Asean Green Bond Standards in November last year, the Asean nations have a strong base from which to provide incentives for both corporates and investors to consider green bond investments in the region. It is also a key enabler of business, potentially attracting investor capital to the region and allowing Asean issuers wider and greater access to investors. As Asia-Pacific undergoes dramatic change and disruption in the coming years, the three little letters E, S and G will bring significant challenges and opportunities for investors and corporates alike. Harnessing the opportunities, managing the risks and overcoming the challenges in a coordinated, holistic manner will be the key to success.

         " In Short The Situation: BlackRock, the world's largest money management firm, has issued a new call to corporate America: Take a leadership role in responding to broader social issues, including sustainability, diversity and economic growth. The Plan: BlackRock's letter to CEOs this year, titled \"A Sense of Purpose,\" asks corporate leaders to focus not only on shareholder returns and financial performance, but also on making positive contributions to society as a whole. Looking Ahead: We urge companies to view the BlackRock letter as an opportunity, not a threat. In a country made exceptional, at least in substantial part, by leadership and innovation driven by capitalism, U.S. companies are uniquely positioned to pursue societal aspirations that make sense for their businesses, stakeholders and communities. With the support of investors like BlackRock, these goals should be viewed as supporting long-term shareholder value, not sacrificing it. In his annual letter, Larry Fink often asks the CEOs of U.S. public companies to accept new responsibilities or rise to new challenges. In recent years, Mr. Fink has urged CEOs to increase the board's role in strategic planning, to articulate long-term strategic goals more clearly, to engage more effectively with shareholders, and to help develop a more secure retirement system for all workers. This year, BlackRock's letter takes a bolder turn—it observes that many governments are failing to prepare for the future on key issues like infrastructure development, automation, and worker retraining, and then asks CEOs to lead the private sector in addressing and responding to broader societal challenges. Some may view BlackRock's request with caution—on its face, the request not only blurs the line between the public and private sectors, but seems to be at odds with the basic tenet that corporations should be managed to maximize long-term value for shareholders. When viewed in light of recent seismic changes in corporate governance, however, the BlackRock missive can be seen as a natural—albeit forward-leaning—progression in the evolution of shareholder engagement. The modern era of governance has been shaped by many trends—including proxy advisor \"withhold vote\" policies, the \"in-housing\" of governance functions at key private funds, \"say-on-pay\" votes, the rise of shareholder activism, and the realization of year-round, real-time, proactive shareholder engagement. If past is prologue, the last decade certainly laid a solid foundation—or at least plenty of foreshadowing—for a call for the private sector to address key social issues. Of course, the issue of whether—and how—companies should address broad social issues can be as hotly debated as the issues themselves. Time will tell whether the BlackRock letter will spur meaningful discussion on those topics, despite the current polarized political climate. But for directors and management, now is the time to consider action. Your companies have the power to effect change. How would you change the world, if you could? The reality is that corporate America is well-positioned to embrace this opportunity; the U.S. regulatory framework and securities markets give public companies not only the freedom to pursue profits but also the flexibility to pursue social aims—and to select those that align with the interests of their shareholders, employees, and communities. Just as \"corporation\" is not a four-letter word, the term \"good corporate citizen\" is not an oxymoron. Moreover, the goal of maximizing shareholder value is not opposed to the public good—shareholder wealth fuels economic growth, and broad social goals are more easily met in times of sustained, long-term macroeconomic growth. Mr. Fink's suggestion is, at bottom, predicated on a perspective that is long-term and not zero-sum as between shareholder and other interests. Of course, as our clients know, we cannot let an opportunity to voice our views on the importance of a long-term outlook in matters of corporate strategy and governance slip. We anticipate that as asset managers and other investors focus on social objectives and long-term corporate responsibility, short-termism and its misplaced focus on quarterly results and earnings forecasts may continue to erode. In closing, the BlackRock letter also raises an important point about the critical role of index funds in today's markets, as well as an important paradox posed by those funds. Individual and institutional investors have in recent years poured massive amounts of assets into indexed funds, which are generally not actively managed, and accordingly have low costs and appeal to a wide range of investors. As Mr. Fink points out, however, investments in these funds are not only long-term, but largely permanent—generally, a fund manager cannot sell its holdings in a particular company as long as the company remains in the relevant index, which aligns with the long-term orientation of individual inventors, who invest (directly or through plans) primarily to fund their retirement or children's educations. Most companies have environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") policies and practices—they do many things to support their employees and communities, think strategically about the future of their business (sustainability), and have extensive policies, practices, and guidelines to ensure compliance with environmental, safety, and other requirements. But not many companies think about or disclose ESG policies holistically. We strongly encourage companies to inventory their policies and practices in this area and begin to disclose them on an organized basis.

         "Article Top Ad Strategy The State of Green Business, 2018 The good news is that the bad news could be worse. Read More By Joel Makower January 16, 2018 (Updated on July 24, 2024) The following is adapted from State of Green Business 2018 , published today by GreenBiz in partnership with Trucost. “Two degrees and the SDGs.” That’s the new sustainable business mantra. It rhymes. You can almost dance to it. The double-barrel impact of the Paris climate agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, both enacted in 2015, is finally being felt as companies begin to align their sustainability goals and, ultimately, their operations with these global commitments. And even though the United States government remains on the sidelines of both efforts, the private sector — allied with states, cities and other nations — is marching forward. If not in lockstep, at least in the same general direction. Indeed, company commitments and achievements continue, unbuffeted by the political winds. Leadership companies such as Walmart and Apple continue to raise the bar — a commitment to remove a billion tons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, in the case of the retail titan, and a pledge to make mobile phones entirely from recycled materials, for the iconic tech company. Newer and smaller firms are making moves, too, ramping up renewable energy purchases and taking on other green initiatives once seen as purely the domain of the world’s biggest brands. Perhaps most important, the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the subsequent rollback of America’s environmental regulations and international commitments galvanized companies to extend or redouble their efforts. “We Are Still In” morphed from a meme to a movement, no longer just a slogan expressing companies’ unrelenting efforts to address climate change, but now a gesture of defiance — a rare instance of the private sector coming together to take on a sitting American president. With more than 2,500 signatories — including 1,700 companies, 200 U.S. cities, nine states, 200 colleges and universities and scores of faith-based institutions — “We Are Still In” has emerged as the largest climate campaign in the United States. That’s the good news. The more challenging part of the story remains the scale, scope and speed of change. For all the corporate defiance, the Trump administration nonetheless has made its mark on the environment — a black mark that, if not indelible, is a stain that will take years, even decades, to erase. And while the administration’s environmental agenda is purportedly pro-business, the corporate crowd seems less enthralled with ideological efforts to undo every environmental regulation and incentive program imaginable, simultaneously paving the way for fossil-fuel and other extractive companies to run amok on even the most pristine and sensitive lands. Where is the pushback? It isn’t coming from C-suites or boardrooms. Companies say they have too many other axes to grind with Congress and the president — infrastructure, immigration, the minimum wage, health care and a general sense that the state of the world is less stable now than at any time since the Cold War. With relatively little public pressure for companies to take a bold stand on climate and related concerns, environmentalism never seems to rise to the top of the corporate agenda. Arguably, it should, and companies’ timidity someday may be seen as short-sighted, much as the failure to recognize or rein in abuses by the financial sector in the mid-2000s led to a global recession that throttled profits and productivity, and reduced shareholder value by trillions. Climate change is being seen by many — notably bankers, insurers and others whose job it is to assess and manage risk — as a threat that, if not existential, could lead to significant negative impacts to operations, supply chains, communities and the well-being of employees and customers. Follow the money There are encouraging signs of an awakening, driven in part by the financial sector, which is just beginning to turn the screws in a way that could force companies to take bigger actions to stem climate change and to address society’s ills, from hunger to poverty to gender equity. Over the past 18 months or so, mainstream investment firms have sharpened their focus on the environmental, social and governance, or ESG, performance of publicly traded companies. In some cases, investors, lenders and ratings groups are starting to redefine “fiduciary responsibility” to include such things as a company’s ESG data or vulnerability to climate risks. The European Union is ground zero for such thinking. There’s a budding movement in the EU to encourage markets to think longer-term, to encourage pension funds to act in the best interest of sustainability and to improve disclosure to help investors understand which investments are sustainable and which probably aren’t. Over time, the thinking goes, ESG data could help determine a company’s inclusion in leading stock indices, such as those from S&P Global or FTSE. But the pressures are being felt in the United States, too. In a report to its clients in November, Moody’s Investors Service explained how it incorporates climate change into its credit ratings for state and local bonds. The takeaway: if cities and states don’t deal with risks from surging seas or intense storms, the cost of borrowing will rise. Suffice to say, this could be a game-changer, in terms of putting climate risk and other environmental and social indicators on a par with traditional financial metrics and risk calculations. In the meantime, the message to corporate boards is implicit, if not explicit: Take stock of your company’s climate and resource risks, as well as its social impacts, both operationally and in its supply chain, as well as the places it operates. (Witness the harm done to businesses in communities ravaged by 2017’s hurricanes.) As Wall Street and its global brethren begin to leverage the ever-growing cache of company-specific data and algorithms — such as using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to pinpoint which company’s facilities are likely to suffer from droughts, extreme heat and sea-level rise, among other calamities — and then make investment decisions based on that data, the changing climate no longer will be seen as external to profits and productivity. Hopeful signs As always, myriad hopeful signs point to shifts, some seismic, in the mainstreaming of sustainable business. The growth of science-based emissions-reduction targets — initially for addressing climate change, but eventually for other environmental issues — is helping companies assess whether their commitments and achievements are sufficient to contribute to meaningful solutions. Renewable energy markets, including for efficiency and storage, are maturing, leading companies to ramp up their purchases, even in an era of stable fossil-fuel prices and shifting tax policies. Next-gen technologies, such as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology, are being deployed in the name of a more sustainable world, tackling big, seemingly intractable challenges. All of this is happening outside the regulatory and policy arena as companies recognize that addressing the international community’s collective climate and sustainable development goals is becoming table stakes for any company seeking to be seen as a leader over the next decade or two. Indeed, “two degrees and the SDGs” may yet become the parlance of mainstream business. And perhaps, someday, we’ll all dance to it.
